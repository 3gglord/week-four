## Voyant
- questions to ask before exploring the data:
  - what is it about?
  - what does it say about something significant? (ie. friendship)
  - what words stand out in the word cloud? what words do you expect to see?
  - how does the langugae change throughout the text? are some words important at the beginning and some at the end?
  - how to correspondences travel? 
  - is there a change over time as the Americas seek autonomy?
- united, kingdom, new, inform, scotland
- clicking a term changes the trends on the right side
- the word "new" increases as time goes on, it is also the most frequent word
- word "mr" is mentioned often, so mostly writing about men
- clicking on multiple terms plots those terms on the graph
