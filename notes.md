## Voyant
- questions to ask before exploring the data:
  - what is it about?
  - what does it say about something significant? (ie. friendship)
  - what words stand out in the word cloud? what words do you expect to see?
  - how does the langugae change throughout the text? are some words important at the beginning and some at the end?
  - how to correspondences travel? 
  - is there a change over time as the Americas seek autonomy?
- united, kingdom, new, inform, scotland
- clicking a term changes the trends on the right side
- the word "new" increases as time goes on, it is also the most frequent word
- word "mr" is mentioned often, so mostly writing about men
- clicking on multiple terms plots those terms on the graph
- used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enjhlnqaXOE) to learn how to embedd html in github
- [posted my embedded visualizatons here](https://paula-rodrigo.github.io/week-four/)
- found it difficult to interpret patters when I don't have a specific idea in mind or argument
- I thought that the dreamscape visualization was interesting because it broadly showed what places newspapers were writing about
  - many reports about Quebec, and America in the Northeast
  - TermBerries visualizaiton shows words that appear near each other and how often they occur (ex. Canada and war)
  

## AntConc
