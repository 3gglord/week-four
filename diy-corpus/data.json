Ca\nsey's baby, several weeks ago, by\nholding the baby over the edge of\nthe water, in bayou Black in front\nof the Casey home, and allowing\nthe child to splash thbwater with\nits feet, an alligator sprang at the\nf baby, caught it by the leg, and\n;t tried to pull the child in the ba\nyou. The faithful nurse held on\nto the child and after a desperate\nfight with the alligator finally res\ncued the child. The surprised\nbaby . had its leg considerably\nbruised by the water monster's\nteeth, and would certainly have\nperished had the old nurse shown\nless presence of mind.-Houma\nCourier.\nA negro by the name of Junius\nLewis was found floating perfect\nly nude in Bayou Teche on Mon\nday evening just below the corpo\nration. The coroner was notified\nand appeared on Tuesday morn\ning for the purpose of holding the\ninquest. He called to his seis\ntance five men to act as jurors.\nWith the meagre informations\ngatlered, the jury could not come\nto any definite conclusion, as the\nbody was considerably swollen and\nundergoing a state of decomposi\ntion, which xendered it extremely\ndoubtful to locate the cause of his\ndeath. Since the inluest was\nheld, the clothes of the unfortu\nnate victim were found lodged on\na fence that projects in the Bayou.\nThere seems to besomething mys\nterious as to the cause of his\ndeath.

Irwin Stone, missionary in Hidia, t<\nhis parents at Berea, O.:\nWe left Bombay on the evening o:\nthe 5th of August for Aurangabad, anc\njourneyed from ten p. m. to six a. m\nby train, when we took a two-wheelec\ncarriage called a tonga for Auranga\nbad, which is 57 miles from the rail\nroad station. We finished our tong\u00a3\njourney at three p. m., well stirred up\nby the rough roads, and the rapid driv\nlug, hut after all it was delightful, be\ncause it was something new.\n^ Aurangabad contained in the days ol\nits glory 200,000 inhabitants, and was\ninclosed by a colossal wall over 6 miles\nin circumference, very high and wide,\nand8trongly built, which stands to this\nday. The glory of that great heathen\ncapital has passed away, and at the\npresent time only about 20,000 people\nlire there, and they are mostly poor.\nOn Monday, August 12, our host with\nhis family started with us for a twc\ndays' excurs'on to visit the great forti\nfied rock called Daulatabad and the\ncolossal caves of Ellora. They loaded a\nbullock cart with provisions, bedding,\netc., and sent them on before us with\n*rvants 14 miles away to the Traveler's\nBungalow, which is situated on a moun\nWn plateau directly over the caves, and\n\u00bbhere we were to remain for the nighl\n\u00bbad take our meals.\n'Hie fortification of Daulatabad being\nhalf way to the caves, we made arrange\nments to visit this wonderful place by\nPouring passes and guides. This place\n\"one of the many things on the earth\n**ro to describe on account of its vast\n**\u00bb\u2022 Even after I saw it it seemed tc\ne 10ore a dream than a reality.\nDaulatabad is a circular shaped moun\nWn of S oii d rock rising out of the plain\n\u00ab\u00fca \u2022 ItS diameter is one-half mile,\n\u2022t appears when a number of miles\nlike a monster hay stack. The\nwall of the fort is two and three\nosrths miles in circumference, 20 feet\nJ? i and 30 feet thick, surrounded by a\n_ deep moat. This outer wall does\nsurround the circular rock, as it is\nan outer fortification to the en\n\u00ae*?\u00bbof the fortress. Passing through\nMassive gateway, the gates of which\nWRrl\u00b0 T i le ^ witk hll \u00a3 e iron spikes, which\nJu'* placed there to prevent the ele\nf\"\u00ae*? \u00b0f an enemy in times of battle\n4 .altering down the gates, we drive\nroilc before reaching the more\nf\u00b0j.tig ec j entrance to the fort\n^ inner fort, or fortress, is also\nnded by a broad moat. In the\nthere 4 ^ are four entrance gates, but\nis \u00b0nly one entrance to the fort\n' 1* to say, eight strongly forti\ngateways, one after another, all\nin the same direction, that is to\n^freat rock. Before reaching the\nj Hat\u00ae of the fortress is a narrow\nhJI C r\u00b0 SSi ^ tke sec \u00b0nd moat, on\n-, 6 w hich stands a very strongly\n_i \u00ab's 6 l'h\u00df one on the right\ni e has two deep horizontal\nr uL ., 1 ;* one a Dove the other, each\na P iece of teak wood\n\u00eehei\u00bb <?\u25a0 lackes square and 14 feet long,\nitaw* , mbers in times of war were\nthe roadway like bars and\n'\u25a0^it th \u00b0 n ^ ne i Qs ide with iron pins so\nj^ e \u00ae ne \u00aey oould not move them,\nhese timbers were immense\ntfiniii\u00b0 n s P an roa< l from\n_ , ar, so that the war elephants\nTeach the bridge crossing the\n*\u00ae\u00aet farther on, after passing\n,, 6 come to the massive gate\ntortress, each door of the\n\u00ae,'r. f66t high, 8 feet wide and\n\u00abtick, plated, banded and\n\u00abon. Over each gateway\nturrets (Bartmn*)\nwhere the guards Constantly lived h\nprotect the entrance. Immediately go\nng through each gateway was a sharr\nurn into a strongly-fortified courtyard\nwhich could not contain more than 10(\narmed men at one time. We went or\nuntil we had passed through four sim\niliariy fortified gateways and courtyards\nAfter passing through the fourth gat(\nwe entered a long narrow street buili\nupon either side with most curiously\nshaped buildings, that are said to have\nbeen the fronts of fortified palaces oj\nthe nobles. We pass along this narrow\nroadway for nearly a quarter of a mile\nuntil we reach another strong gate.\nPassing through this we make the\nusual short turn into a fortified court\nyard, and so on, until we pass through\nthree more of the same kind, and\ncome face to face with the great rock\nDaulatabad. Daulatabad is surrounded\nby a moat cut down into the solid rock\n90 feet deep and 140 feet wide. Now\ncomes what was to me the most wonder\nful of all, and that is, this rock moun\ntain has smooth perpendicular eut sides\nall around it, which measures from the\ntop of the scarp to the water in the moat\n150 feet. After passing over this rock\ncut moat, we enter the perpendicular\nside of the rock into a narrow, dark and\nwinding tunnel, which is the only possi\nble entrance up to the palace of the\nking, which stands within a hundred\nfeet of the top of the rock. Our guide\nwalked before us carrying a burning\nflambeau made of cotton saturated with\noil. The tunnel is very steep and we\nascended by climbing the rock cut stairs.\n^<ear the top of the tunnel we enter a\ngallery which is about 12 feet square,\ncut out of the solid rock. In this gallery\nstands a massive iron brazier, so shaped\nthat when it was laid down it perfectly\ncovered the entrance from below. In\ntimes of war this brazier was fastened\ndown and a great fire built upon it, mak\ning the air in the tunnel so hot that no\none could enter it and live, and by this\nmeans every possible entrance to the\nrock was effectually stopped. When at\nlast the Mohammedans captured Daula\ntabad from the Hindoos it was at the end\nof a twelve years' seige and then only\nby starvation.\nFrom this gallery we came out into\nthe light to behold a most lovely sight\nin the plains below, such a landscape\nbeing seldom ever seen. Ascending 100\nfeet higher we enter the old Hindoo\npalace of the king, now a home for owls,\nbats and swallows. Above the palace\n100 feet is a large circular bastion cover\ning the entire top of the rock and on the\ntop of this bastion is an enormous bronze\ncannon 20 feet in length resting upon\nan old decayed gun carriage which\nhas served that old cannon for hun\ndreds of years. All the work of this\nfort, fortress and fortified rock, costing\ninfinite labor and expense, was just\nsimply to protect one man. the King.\nWe wind our way back through this im\npregnable way to our tonga, where we\ntake our breakfast under the shade of a\nlarge pepul tree, a tree sacred to the\nHindoos. After breakfast we start on\nour journey of 7 miles to the Ellora\ncaves, which place we reach at one p. m.\nThe traveler's bungalow, where we\nwere to tarry for the night, stood on the\nbrink of a mountain range nearly one\nthousand feet high. The range is in the\nform of a crescent and the bungalow\nstands in the very center. Back of the\nbungalow is a beautiful plateau of green\nfields; before us a thousand feet below\nis the most lovely valley I ever saw, ex\ntending 20 miles. In the base of the\nmountain, 50 feet above the valley and for\na mile and a half along'this crescent, are\nthe rock cut caves and temples of Ellora.\nY T ou must remember these temples are\nnot built up of rock by the hand of work\nmen, but caves, pillars, capitals and im\nages are cut out of the solid rock, each\none being a fixture. They are of three\ndenominations, consisting of Buddhists,\nJains, and the Brahmins. The Buddhists\nhave, one after another, 12 temple caves,\nthe Brahmins, coming next in order\nalong the crescent, have 17, and the\nJains have 8.\nOf these 32 temple caves limited space\nwill admit of descriptions of but two of\nthe largest and most gorgeous, the first\nof which is described as follows:\nThe Buddhists chose as a site for their\nfirst temple or cave a place underneath\nand back of a waterfall. They cut away\nthe rock underneath the waterfall which\nformed a covered corridor or roadway a\nnumber of feet wide and perhaps 15 feet\nhigh, the hack of this corridor forming\nthe front of the cave temple and the en\ntrance to it. Passing through the en\ntrance door and climbing a number of\nrock cut steps, wo enter an immense cave\ncarved out of the solid rock of the moun\ntain, and as beautifully cut and carved\nas the finest polished stone work sculp\nturing you ever saw. The sides of this\ngreat cave are covered from floor to ceil\ning with every conceivable design of\nheathen art, such as idols, men, women,\nchildren, cattle, elephants, lions, tigers,\nbirds, trees, and lotus flowers, all of life\nsize and standing out from the heavy\nwall boldly as though statuary had been\nplaced there. Every little way round\nthis spacious hall will be found dark,\ncheerless cells about 12 feet square.\nThese cells were the homes or holy\nplaces for the holy men (fakirs), who\nspent all their lives in the cave.\nThe ceiling of this temple cave, which\nis decorated with many religious designs\nof the ancient Buddhists, is supported\nby a massive but very richly-carved pil\nlars with beautiful sculptured capitals.\nThe space between the walls of the cave\nand the pillars form a hall about 10 feet\nwide all around the temple, which is 80\nfeet square. The space inside the pil\nlars forms the great auditorium or wor\nshiping hall. At the farther end of the\nhail, resting upon a throne supported by\ncrouching lions, sits the large figure of\nBuddha, before which thousands upon\nthousands of poor deluded creatures\nbowed near 1,800 years ago. The floors\nof these temples have been worn as\nsmooth as glass by the many and fre\nquent kneeling and prostrating of the\nworshipers.\nThe second which rightly claims a\nplace in this article is called the Kailos\n(pronounced Kylos,) and is a colossal\nmonolithic temple, standing in an open\ncourtyard, cut out of the mountain side.\nThis courtyard, in which the temple\nstands, is 270 feet long and 150 feet wide.\nIn your imagination, stand before a gran\nite mountain 1,000 feet high ; 50 feet up\nfrom the valley cut a trench directly into\nthe mountain 270 feet long, 22 feet wide,\nand when the trench is completed it will\nbe 107 feet deep at the deepest place; turn\nnow at right angles another trench 118\nfeet long, 22 feet wide and 107 feet deep,\nthen turn at right angles again and cut\nyour way out of the mountain then you\nwill have two trenches 270 feet long and\n118 feet long, 22 feet wide and 107 feet\ndeep in the deepest place. This will\nleave in the center a huge block of stone\nfreed from the mountain by the trenches\n164 feet long, 109 feet wide, and 107 feet\nhigh in the highest place, Out of this\nmonolith of stone, these wonderful men\nof the ancient days carved this, the\nmost unparalleled temple for heathen\nworship that the eye of mankind ever\nbeheld. The temple is two stories high,\nand its basement is supported upon a\nfrieze of life size elephants.\nAt the entrance of the courtyard, from\nwall to 'wall, is a panelled fence, or\nstone partition, 118 feet long, 15 feet\nhigh, and two feet thick. We enter the\ncourtyard through an elaborately dec\norated arched gateway, passing between\ntwo life-size stone elephants, facing each\nother, that seem to stand as guards. We\ngo into the temple by passing under\nneath a huge balconied-veranda, enter\ning a room filled with richest carving of\nalmost every conceivable thing. Pass\ning out of the place under a carved\ngallery of solid stone, we ascend the\nbroad stairway to the second story, or\nupper temple, and going on from room\nto room, each one surpassing the other\nif possible, we reach the main hall of\nworship.\nThis hall is 57 feet square, and 30 feet\nhigh, sculptured far beyond my powers\nof description or understanding.\nOn the outside of the main hall is an\nuncovered veranda 26 feet wide, upon\nwhich is built five beautiful shrines or\nminiature temples containing an altar\nfor the burning of sacrifices and pools\nfor the catching of the blood. .This un\nparalleled temple with its forest of pil\nlars and pilasters, its balconied porches\nand double pavilions, are all carved\nwith different details of sculpture,\nevery thing from the dome to the floor\nof the courtyard going to prove that this\ntemple was the grandest attempt to\nrival all others before it, and perhaps\nwill till the end of time.\nWe will now go down out of \"Kailos\"\ninto the courtyard again, and, on the\nright hand side of the court, we pass\nunder a great balcony of overhanging\nrock, caused by an excavation having\nbeen made in the perpendicular side of\nthe mountain wall or scarp. This pro\njecting balcony was made by the moun\ntain wall having being cut away 30 feet\nhigh from the floor of the courtyard, and\n25 feet hack under the mountain. The\nprojection extends all the way around\nthe court without any support. When\nyou go back under the 25 feet of project\ning rock you will come to a flight of five\nsteps which brings you on to a veranda\nwhich is still farther sunk back under\nthe mountain rock some 18 feet. This\nveranda is supported by many carved\npillars and the sides and ceiling are very\nrichly decorated, being sunk back under\nthe mountain 43 feet, 25 of them\nwithout support, 18 feet supported by\npillars. Two of these verandas are 118\nfeet long, and one 210 feet long, forming\nthree sides of the courtj ard.\nGo back to the courtyard again, but\nover to the left hand side, ascend a few\nsteps and we stand in a rock cut vesti\nbule 30 feet long, 20 feet wide, 12 to 15\nfeet high. This, like all the other cave\nrooms, is decorated with idols. From this\nvestibulo we ascend by a spiral stairway\nto a cave temple called Lank-es-bara.\nThis cave is one of marvelous beauty,\n123 feet long, by 60 feet wide. The ceil\ning is supported by 21 massive pillars\nand corresponding pilasters, all richly\ncarved; the floor of the central hall is\nraised above the surrounding aisles\nthree stops high; the ceiling abovo is\nsimilarly elevated by a double archi\ntrave surrounding it; the pillars stand\ning on the outer edge of the elevation\nand each having bold capitals and\nbrackets beautifully carved upon them.\nIn one end of this cave temple is a very\nlarge idol of Brahma seated upon a\nthrone, and at the other end in a con\ncave vestibule is a sacred bull. There\nwas once a bridge of stone connecting\nthis cave with the great Kailos which\nstands 22 feet away, but it has ages ago\nfallen. From 15,000 to 20,000 worshipers\nmight assemble in the temple caves,\ncorridors and courts of the Kailos at one\ntime, and every one of them could find\nfrom where they stood something of\nadoration for their darkened minds.\n\u2014Stranger\u2014\"Haven't you anything\nbetter than five cent cigars?\" Country\nstorekeeper (astonished)\u2014\"Hi, Jimmy,\nrun down to the Indicator office an' tell\nthem Mr. Wanderbilt is'n town.'\n\u2014\"I see you have mortgaged youi\nhomestead, Mulligatawney; what does\nthat mean?\" \"O, I merely bought a ton\nof hard coal, that's alL\"\u2014Oma^a World.\n!\n.\nWEST POINT ACADEMY\nHow It Is Managed and How Appoint\nments Are Made.\n! Each Congressional district and Ter\nritory\u2014also the District of Columbia\u2014\n. is entitled to have one cadet at the\nacademy, the cadet to be named by the\nRepresentative in Congress. There are\nalso ten appointments at large, specially\nconferred by the President of the United\nStates. The number of students is thus\nlimited to 349.\nAppointments are usually made one\nyear in advance of date of admission,\nand are made by the Representative.\nThe Representative may nominate a\nlegally qualified second candidate, to be\ndesignated the alternate. The alternate\nwill receive from the War Department\na letter of appointment, and will be\nexamined with the regular appointee,\nand if duly qualified will be admitted\nto the academy in the event of the fail\nure of the principal to pass the prelimi\nnary examination. Appointees to the\nmilitary academy must be between sev\nenteen and twenty-two years of age,\nfree from any infirmity which may ren\nder them unfit for military service, and\nable to pass a careful examination in\nreading, writing, orthography, arithme\ntic, grammar, geography and history of\nthe United States.\nThe course of instruction, which is\nquite thorough, requires four years, and\nis largely mathematical and profes\nsonal. The principal subjects taught\nare mathematics, French, drawing, tac\ntics of all arms of the service, natural\nand experimental philosophy, chemistry,\nminerology, geology, and electricity,\nhistory, international, constitutional,\nand military law, Spanish, and civil\nand military engineering, and science of\nwar. About one-fourth of those ap\npointed usually fail to pass the prelim\ninary examination, and but little over\none-half the remainder finally graduate.\nThe discipline is very strict\u2014even more\nso than in the army\u2014and the enforce\nment of penalties for offenses is inflexi\nble rather than severe. Academic duties\nbegin September 1. Examinations are\nheld in each January and June, and\ncadets found proficient in studies and\ncorrect in conduct are given the particu\nlar standing in their class to which their\nmerits entitle them, while those cadets\ndeficient in either conduct or studies are\ndischarged.\nFrom about the middle of June to the\nend of August cadets live in camp, en\ngaged only in military duties and receiv\ning practical military instruction. Ca\ndets are allowed but one leave of ab\nsence during the four years' course, and\nthis is granted at the expiration of the\nfirst two years. The pay of a cadet is\n\u00c7540 per year, and, With proper economy,\nit is sufficient for his support. The\nnumber of students at the academy if\nusually about 300.\nUpon graduating cadets are commis\nsioned as Second Lieutenants in the\nUnited States army. It is virtually ab\nsolutely necessary for a person seeking\nan appointment to apply to his member\nof Congress. The appointments by the\nPresident are usually restricted to sons\nof officers of the army.\u2014Toledo Blade.\nTHE HARMLESS ALLIGATOR.\nAn Animal That Attends Strictly to His\nBusiness of Eating and Drinking.\nThis animal is a saurian, and flourishes\nIn the water near orange groves. It is\nconsiderably larger in length than it is\nthe other way, and travels on land and\nin the water by means of four short legs\nconveniently placed on the under part of\nits body. It is all tail from its rear legs\nrearward, and all mouth from its fore\nlegs forward; the rest of the animal\nsimply serves to hold its head and tail\ntogether. The head and tail of the\nalligator are the best parts of him to let\nalone. Its head is constructed with a\nview to barely cover the large mouth\nthat goes with it, and is considerably\ndistorted when the mouth is open. The\nalligator's month is harmless when it is\nopen; it is when it shuts that the danger\noccurs, and safety lies in being some\nwhere else when that happens. The tail\nof the beast is capable of a horizontal\nagitation only, and it is highly danger\nous to be within its reach when it is\nagitated.\nAside from its usefulness as a check\non the increase of the colored popula\ntion in the South, the alligator is useful\nin furnishing leather for alligator shoes\nand traveling bags and sport for North\nern tourists, though the tourist does not\nalways have all the sport; the alligator\nhas his inning once in a while, and when\nit does there is a trunk and a pair of\nboots sent North without a tourist.\nThe alligator is a quiet, orderly an\nimal that tends strictly to its business\nof eating and sleeping. It would be a\ngood substitute for a pug dog as a ladies'\nboudoir pet.\u2014E. R.

The young men develop a keen\nlove for metaphysical doctrine and re\nsearch, but their favorite anthers are\nMill, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley.

The scene of the wood\ncut is an Alsatian mine of the first part\nof the sixteenth century. Munster calls\nthe car in question instrumentum tract\norum, and mentions that its four wheels\nwere of iron.\nWOMEN AS DENTfSTS.\nInteresting: Information Given by a Tooth\nCarpenter's Female Assistant.\nQuite lately the dentists of St. Louis\nhave begun to employ young women as\noffice assistants. I am one of them, and\nthere are probably about a dozen others\nin the city. We are paid from $6 to $10\na week, and I believe that our employers\nthink that our help is worth fully that\nmuch to them. We talk to people when\nthey first come into the office, cross and\nImpatient, and if they have to wait try\nto get them into a good humor in the\nmeantime. You can imagine that it re\nquires tact to deal with a person suffer\ning from a raging toothache. We ex\nplain operations to people who want to\nknow all about it before they put them\nselves into the hands of a dentist, and,\nconvince them that their foars of terri\nble pain are groundless. When the den\ntist is performing filling operations, 1\nstand by and hand him the instruments\nand material needed. This saves the\ndelay so exasperating to a patient sit\nting with nerves all on edge in a den\ntist's chair. When teeth are to be pulled\nI help the dentist to administer the gas,\nand if the patient is a woman I fre\nquently stand by her side and hold her\nhand sympathetically. Some people may\nlaugh at this, but it's an immense help\nto the person in the chair. Once or\ntwice when a very nervous man was be\ning operated on I have taken his hand\nand it really braced his nerves wonder\nfully. It's a fact that women are much\nbraver in a dentist's office than men are,\nand I really think that the bigger and\nmore robust a man is the greater coward\nhe is when he sees the dentist's instru\nments. . And cross! Why, it seems to\nbe one time in a man's life when he be\nlieves he has a right to make himself as\ndisagreeable as he wants to behave. My\nbusiness is unpleasant only in the severe\ntest that it is to the nerves, and a girl\nmust be self-controlled and phlegmatic\nto do well in it.

Therefore the housewife, recog\nnizing their worth, keeps a good supply of\nthese articles when she possibly can.\nAs the price of eggs varies with the\ndifferent seasons, it is the best and most\neconomical plan to purchase them while\ncheap and pack them away for use in\ntheir scarce season.\nIt is very important that eggs packed\naway shall be fresh when put away, else\nall the labor spent in packing will be of\nlittle use. There are many ways of test\ning a fresh egg, but the easiest is to hold\nthe egg up to the light, and if on look\ning through it, it is clear in the center\nit is safe to pack away, but if the clear\nness is at the ends, it is not fresh and\nshould not be put away.\nTo pack eggs away for any length of\ntime, take pieces of newspaper six inches\nsquare, and do up one egg in each,\ntwisting the ends of the paper very\ntightly, similar to the way in which the\npaper wrapped around oranges is twisted.\nPlace the eggs in layers, small enda\ndown, and put away in a cool, dry place.\nAnother way in which the eggs may be\nkept for a year, is the following: To\na pail of cold water, add a scant pint of\nfresh, air-slacked lime, and a pint of\ncommon salt. Fill a crock half full of\nthis liquid and put the eggs in it any\ntime after June. Keep them in a cool,\ndry place.\nA good substitute for eggs, when they\nare scarce, is to put away at night a cup\nof mashed potatoes, in to which has been\nmixed a teaspoonful of sugar, beat well,\nand it will be found excellent to put\ninto the pancake batter in the morning.\nIt will make the cakes so light and\nsweet that the absence of eggs will\nnever be noticed.\nFor most invalids and delicate people\nthere are few things that will take tho\nplace of a soft boiled egg for its nutri\ntious qualities. Eggs beaten in milk can\noften be taken when other food is re\njected. Beat two raw eggs in a glass\nand aid to it one-half glass of fresh\nmilk, stirring in the milk thoroughly\nwhile mixing. Sweeten to taste.\nThe white of an egg is excellent for\nBurns, and the little skin that lines the\nshell is claimed to be wonderfully sooth\ning and healing for boils. The yelk of\nan egg beaten thoroughly in enough\nwater o make it run freely is the best\nthing we know for cleansing the scalp,\nrubbing it in well, and afterwards rins\ning the head in clear water. Crushed,\negg shells are good to put in the food\nfor poultry, also excellent to \u00bblean glw?\nbottles,\u2014Boston Budget", "batch": "lu_meowth_ver01", "title_normal": "bossier banner.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85034235/1890-02-20/ed-1/seq-1.json", "place": ["Louisiana--Bossier--Bellevue", "Louisiana--Bossier--Benton"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 1, "county": ["Vermilion"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Weekly", "id": "/lccn/sn88064005/1898-07-30/ed-1/seq-1/", "subject": ["Abbeville (La.)--Newspapers.", "Louisiana--Abbeville.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01218331", "Louisiana--Vermilion Parish.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01221185", "Vermilion Parish (La.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Abbeville"], "date": "18980730", "title": "The Meridional.", "end_year": 1906, "note": ["\"Official journal of Vermilion parish.\"", "\"The oldest paper in Southwest Louisiana.\"", "Also issued on microfilm from Louisiana State University Microfilm Dept.", "Archived issues are available in digital format as part of the Library of Congress Chronicling America online collection.", "Description based on: Vol. 20, no. 26 (Dec. 22, 1877).", "In English and French.", "Published with an additional masthead in French: Le meridional, <Dec. 22, 1877>-Feb. 6, 1886."], "state": ["Louisiana"], "section_label": "", "type": "page", "place_of_publication": "Abbeville, La.", "start_year": 1856, "edition_label": "", "publisher": "Widow E.

A corres\npondent of the Jennings Record thus\ndescribes it:\n\"One who has never been in the\nLake Arthur camp meeting grounds\ncan draw no imaginary picture of\ntheir beauty. Situated on the north\nbank of a beautiful lake under a large\ngroup of antique oaks, with a cool\nbreeze continually fanning you from\noff the lake, makes a visitor feel as\nthough he had struck the garden\nspot of the world.\nThe tabernacle is a magnificent\nbuilding capable of seatmg 600 or 700\npeople. A large roomy parsonage, a\nstranger's home, several two story\nhouses, now occupied by some of the\nleading men of the country, a large\nwharf that enables steamboats to\nland passengers right on the ground.\nAll of this has been done in a short\nspace of six months.\nThe association purchased ten\nacres of ground with a lake frontage\nof five acres that has no equal in the\nstate.\nThe camp meeting will commence\non the 20th inst. The best ministe\nrial help has been secured and a large\ncrowd is expected and a great revival\nwill be the result. Everybody is ip\nvited to attend. Rooms will befurn\nished free and meals at 20 cents on\nthe ground.\nBathing, fishing and skiff riding\nare greatly enjoyed and no mosqui\ntoes to interfere with your rest. In\nshort, it is one of the greatest ,places\nto spend a few weeks that the writer\nknows of, besides what a spiritual\nblessing one can receive.\"\nQUITE A SENSATION.\nThe latest sensation comes from\none of neighborihg railroad towns\nand the story goes that a prominent\nrailrader- went home when he was\nexpected to be out on a run. He had\njust disrobed, when his wife who had\nbeen looking very uneasy, told him\nthat she had taken very ill and he\nwould have to go for a doctor. The\naccommodating husband got into his\nclothes as quickly as possible and\nrushed up town only to discover that\nthe clothes he had on were not his,\nbut belonged to one of his best\nfriends. He went through the pock\nets and found a hundred and twenty\nfive dollars in the vest. The railroad\ner immediately telephoned his friend\nthat he could have his coat and trous\ners back, but he had decided to keep\nthe vest. The exchange was made\nand the railroader is now a hundred\nand twenty-five dollars and a ,lot of\nexperience ahead. His friend also\nhas some experience, but will be\nbroke until Eay day.\nAn Alligator Attacks a Baby.\nWhile an old 6olored nurse was\namusing Mrs. Thomas Casey's baby,\nseveral weeks ago, by holding the\nbaby over the edge of the water, in\nbayou Black in front of Casey's\nhome, and allowing the baby to splash\nthe water with its feet, an alligator\nsprang, at the baby, caught it by. the\nleg, and tried to pull the child in the\nbayou. Th\u00fd faithful nurse held on\nto the child and after a idesperate\nfight with the alligator, finally rescued\nthe child. The surprised baby had\nits leg considerably bruised, by the\nwater monster's teeth; and would\ncertainly have parished had the old\nnurse shown less presence of mind.\nioma ..om (lrier.\nAS INSTRUCTED.\nWhen it was first arranged some\nyears ago for postmasters in,the Unit\ned States to send in quarterly reports\nmany queer documents were furnishT'\ned.\nOne of the funniest, addressedt9\nthe President himself, came from\nWaterford, -Fulton county, Illinois,\nand is a model of comprehensiveness,\nif not of a grammatical precision.

The in\nsde of the school-house was first abund\natlv trimmed with evergreen, then a\ne was erected in one corner for a\n1er, and next a long table was ar\naaged at the back of tlxe room for the\nafreshments, which were brought in\n\u00bbketsby several of the boys and girls\ntom time to time. Finally the table\n\u00e0ths were spread, and the girls drew\nto the mysterious baskets frosted\nakes wrapped in tissue-paper, great\nMoated pies, nuts and raisins, oranges\nad big bunches of grapes, paper bags\nied with candy, and, in fact, a quant it\nrfgood things that made Seph's moutu\n*\u00bbter while he looked in through one of\n'\u25a0k windows.\nAt home, late in the afternoon, Job\nPotter secretly led him up to an unfin\nished room over the wood-shed, and\nshowed him his mask and outfit, which\nwere hidden away in a barrel. He made\nSeph try on the mask, the old beaver\nhw and the coat, just to see how they\nwere going to look.\n\"Father is mighty sot on not lettin'\nme go,' said J ob, ' ' but 1' m a-goin' now,\nyou better believe. Don't say anything,\n,1 \u00bbugh.

Without saying\nanything, he pushed by them and en\ntered.\n\"Here's Job!\" \"Here's Job!\" shouted\nevery one at once; and before Seph could\nmake up his mind what to do, fifteen or\ntwenty boys and girls in masks began to\ncaper a round him. As soon as he did\ncollect his scattered wits, however, he\ndecided to play that he was dumb, and\nrefused to \u00bbpeak. That made them langh,\nand shortly they left him to greet another\narrival.\nNobody, indeed, seemed to have the\nleast suspicion who he really was. They'd\n\"neber eotch him to let dem know,\nneeder,\" Seph ruminated.

Who ever could have supposed\nthat curiosity would have prompted the\ntwo good old people to look in and see\nwhat the young folks were about, even\nthough thev diu not appi-ove of such go\nings on P\nBut in the meantime Seph enjoyed\nhimself amazingly. He watched the\ntable longingly; he listened to the fiddle,\nand danced until he was out of breath;\nhe played chase the squirrel, and had\ncapital fun for an hour or more; then the\nend was at hand,\nWhile standing in the middle of the\nfloor, hesitating what to take 'part in\nnext, he happened to notice a face out\nside one of the windows, and it did not\ntake him more than the thousandth part\nof a second to recognize the Deacon\nlooking straight at him. It was a tre\nmendous moment, and Seph could al\nmost feel the wool on the top of his head\nuncurl and rise right up under his hat.\nHis first impulse was to make a rush\nfor the door. When he crossed the en\ntry door-sill, however, he stubbed one\nfoot and fell, and the Deacon's hand was\non him before he could recover himself.\nHe led Seph down the road, Mrs. Pot\nter following close behind and pleading\nfor mercy, as mothers do.\nBut in a moment the mask fell off, and\nthe Deacon, amazed, let go his hold.\n\"What\u2014!\"\nSeph did not wait to hear anything\nmore, but ran into the bushes* then\nleaped over a fence, and ran at his best\nspeed across an acre or two of plowed\nground.\n\" By golly!\" he gasped, dropping\ndown at last exhausted. \" I reckon I's\nglad I'm black dis yere time, anyhow!\"\nSorelv disappointed, however, he\nskulked back to the bain, and there\nanother misfortune overtook him\u2014his\nown clothes had disappeared.\nFor a moment or two this startling dis\ncovery was too much for his intellect to\ngrasp. He searched hefle and there des\nperately, overturned the hay, upset a\nbarrel of oats, frightened the hens fi-om\ntheir roosts, and got the horse to\nneighing. Then, scared and bewildered,\nhe rushed outside, undecided what to do.\nSurprise, however, awaited him here\nagain. In a moment he saw himself\u2014or\nat least somebody with a black face and\nhis clothes on\u2014steal out from the wood\nshed near by, and hurry down to the\nroad.\nIf he \"wasn't himself, who in de world\nwas he? dat's what he'd like to know.\"\nBut in about three minutes, when he\nsaw the mysterious personage ' and the\nDeacon meet unexpectedly near a great\ntree that stood in the yard, he was never\nso glad in his life to be in some other fel\nlow's clothes.\nSeph ran over to the wood-shed,\nclimbed up the ladder to the chamber\nabove, and began to disrobe himself of\nJob's clothes in a hurry. He had got\nthem all off, when that personage came\nscrambling up the ladder also, and the\ntwo confronted each other in the strag\ngling moonbeams that found their way\nthrough a cobwebbed window.\nWhatyer gwine to do wid my clothes\non, Job Potter?\" Seph asked, wrathful\niy\nNothin'.

They had secured a stick of wood\nwhich was to long to be conveniently car\nried, and desired to break it in two.\nSuch was the problem to be solved, and\nthey went about the business as follows:\nThe stubborn stick was placed in a\nslanting position against a bowlder some\nfour feet in height. This being arrang\ned two squaws raised a rock that would\nweigh about 150 pounds, and placed it\non the head of a third sqaw. The squaw\nafter properly poising the rock with her\nhands, made a short run, then springing\nfrom her'feet, after the fashion of a\nfighting ram, discharged the ponderous\nrock.\nShe missed her aim. The rock, after\ndescribing a curve of several feet in the\nair, fell with a crash against the bowlder\nalongside of the stick of wood.\nShe was evidently a good deal cha\nrmed at the failure of the first effort.\nWhen the rock was again poised upon\nher head, she walked off some thirty\nfeet, and when she darted forward, it\nwas plainly to be seen that she meant\nmischief.\nRunning forward some twenty feet\nshe suddenly bounded high in the air\nand discharged the great rock. Being\nbut light and slender, when the heavy\nrock left her head all ballast was gone\nand she spun around in the air some\nfour or five times, finally coming down\non her feet and all right. The result of\nher effort was, however, somewhat dis\nastrous to one of her assistants. The\nstick was fairly struck and broken, but\nthe upper end of it flew back and struck\nthe largest and fattest squaw squarely\nin the stomach, stretching her upon the\nground as one dead. A great outcry\nwas raised by all the squaws and pa\npooses, a lot of bucks came tearing down\nthe railroad track from the neighborhood\nof the lumber-yards, and for a time\nthere was a great commotion. A few\nhandfulls of snow finally brought the\ninjured squaw to her legs, and when\nshe got up she gazed wildly about as\nthough wondering to see that no one\nelse was injured by the explosion. \u2014 Vir\nginia Enterprise. '\nThe Rabbit Plague in Australia.\nWe have lately been told by an Anti\npodean contemporary that a desperate\nstruggle is now going on in South\nAustralia between man and rabbit \"for\nthe survial of the fittest.\" Every device\nlias been tentatively employed by the\nfarmer to get the better of his destruc\ntive and ubiquitous little enemy, but\n\"Providence\"\u2014as Napoleon was want\nto say\u2014\"favors big battalions.\" and the\nvictory remains hitherto with the swarm\ning armies of the aggressive rodent.\nFerrets, stoats and weasels have been\nimported from England and turned down\namong the rabbit-infested districts; but\nthe extraordinary and unnatural result\nhas been that, after a short time, the\nmustelid.-c or weasel tribes began to\nfraternize with.the \"nimble, skipping\nlittle animals,\" as Lord Granville once\ncalled rabbits in the House of Lords.\nFor a while it was hoped that poison, in\nthe form of steeped wheat or of phos\nphorized oats, would keep the rabbits\ndown; but hitherto they have triumphed\nover the puny onslaughts of their human\nassailants. It has been suggested\u2014and\nby no one more forcibly than by Lord\nElcho\u2014that wire-netting should be\nthrown around the Australian wheat\nfields to keep the rabbits out; but the ex\npense is great, for the rabbit is a great\njumper, and can easily clear an obstacle\nwhich is less titan four feet in height.\nLord Elcho gave a hint in these columns\nto Australian agriculturists how to plant\ntheir wire-netting so that the rabbits\neonld not burrow under it, his advice be\ning that the bottom of the netting should\nhe biu-ied underground, with an elbow\nturned up two or three inches below the\nsurface, and running outward at right\nangles to the upright stand. The rabbit,\nwhen he begins to burrow, soon lights\nupon the buried obstruction, and gives\nup the attempt to scratch his way under\nthe upright wire-netting which protects\nthe crop from its hungry teeth. \u2014London\nTelegraph.\nSpace and Electricity.\nHow far we have annihilated space\nand time by means of electricity let the\nfollowing incident, related by the Times\nof India, show: \"During the repairs\nof the telegraph cable near Bombay, the\nsteamers Chiltern and Great Northern\nwere about half a mile apart, the for\nmer having hold of a shore cable, and so\nwas in telegraphic communication with\nBombay; the latter having hold of a sea\nend, and so was in telegraphic commu\nnication with Aden. The Chiltern de\nsired the Great Northern to splice on to\nthe cable end held by the latter, and\npay out three-quarters of a mile of cable,\nand this was communicated by wire\nfrom the test-room of the Chiltern pass\ning through all the coils of cables in her\nhold and on to Bombay, whence it was\nsent on to Aden, and back from Aden\nto the Great Northern. Thus, as a\nspeedy means of sending a message half\na mile, it was forwarded by .a route be\ntween three and four thousand miles\nlong. The following morning, when the\ntwo vessels were within a quarter of a\nmile of each other communications\npassed between them constantly in the\nsame way.\" It is quite evident that as\nrailway and steamboat traveling and\ntelegraphing progress we shall have to\nadopt some other means of measuring\ndistances than those we now posess.\n\u2014Nervous spasms are usually relieved\nby a little salt taken into the mouth and\nallowed to dissolve.\nGeneral Gage and tlie Boston Boys of\n1775.\nIn Butterworth's \" Young Folks'\nHistory' of Boston\" it is said that the\nfrog pond does not look as it did when\nthe British soldiers prevented the boys\nfrom sliding and skating there, and the\ndelegations of voung Americans waited\nupon General Cage, and laid before hint\nthe story of their wrongs.\nUA s the British soldiers did not prevent\nthe boys from sliding and skating on\nthe frog pond, it would be hard to tell\nwherin its appearance has been altered;\nmoreover the Itoys did not lay the\nstory of their wrong before General\nGage.\nAt this statement there will he at once\nan expression of incredulity, and our re\nply would be substantially that there\nare some errors which it is a pity should\ncontinue to be perpetrated with the sanc\ntion of so many distinguished names.\nThese are that the coast was not on\nthe Common; that it was not destroyed\nby the British soldiers; the boys did not\ncall on General Gage at the Province\nhouse; and he did not know of the mat\nter until told of it, after all was over, by\nthe ofticer on whom they did call.\nThis, if correct, would seem to leave\nvery little of the story, and yet there is\na subtractum of truth in it, and the cor\nrect story is fully as good as that which\nhas been so often repeated incorrectly.\nRev. Dr. Hale, who, at the dinner of\n(he Latin school association in 1877,\nfirst pointed out the inaccuracy of the\npicture, told the story as it hail been\ntold to him thirty years before by one of\nthe boys.\nThe coast was from near the corner of\nBeacon and Somerset street, down the\nhill to the foot of School Street. The\nboys of the Latin school used to bring\ntheir sleds to school, and after school\ncoast down the street. In a house op\nposite the school, near the prosent site\nof the city hall, lived the British General\nHalilimaiid, the Colonel of Gage's own\nregiment. His servant spread ashes on\nthe coast, and the boys of the Latin\nschool appointed a committee from the\nfirst class to see the General and com\nplain of the servant. He received them\nkindly, said he had trouble enough with\nthe Boston men, and would not have any\nwith the boys and sent a servant out to\nbrush off the coast. Afterwards he\nmentioned the visit to General Gage,\nwho made in reply a remark sufficiently\nresembling that which he is reported to\nhave made to the boys to render it pos\nsible that it was the foundation of the\ncommon tale. \u2014Boston Transcript.\nThe Second-Hand Book.\nA week or two ago a bright and\nchatty young woman called at a house\non Cass Avenue aid endeavored to\nmake the sale of a hook entitled\" Home\nand Mother.\" The ladies of the house\nreceived her in the usual ten degrees\nbelow fashion and, utterly refusing to\nlook at the hook, she said:\n\" I haven't any money, and I know\nthat my husband wouldn't pay for it.\"\n\"It is a book highly spoken of by the\npress.\"\n\"Yes, I know, but my husband is\nqueer.\"\n\" And you sec the superior style of\nbinding.\"\n\"T know, but my husband would call\nit bosh and trash.\"\n\" Shxn't I call when he is at home?\"\n\"That would be useless.

Special\nis\nis\nit\nI\nI\nI\na\n1\nif\nif\nof\nThe Hen ami the Alligator.\nThe St. John's River is the alligator's\nparadise. Its shallow bauks keep the al\nligators out of harm's way from the pass\ning boat. There they lay stretched out\non the sand, with no one to molest them.\nNow and then a passing shot from some\nfool on a steamboat wakes one up, when\nhe opens both eyes wide, takes one look\naround, and sinks in the water till the\nfool gets by. The chances of killing an\nalligator with a rifle are about one in 500.\nUnless you hit him in the eye, you have\nno chance at all. His throat and the lit\ntle tender spot under his fore legs, are\nalways well covered. The bone of the\nalligators head\u2014that is, his long skull\u2014\nis at least an inch thick. Nothing but\nthe ball from a field-battery would dis\nturb him at all. Buckshot would be noth\ning but mosquito-bites to an old alliga\ntor. Alligators lay their eggs in the\nsand, in a sunny place where the tem\nperature is sure to be warm enough to\nsustain animal growth. If a cold snap\nconies, it kills the life of the egg, just the\nsame as the chickens die in a hen's egg\nwhen the old hen stops off too long. In\nthe case of the alligator the warm sand\nis the nest, and the sun is the old hen.\nThe sun sits on the nest all day, and gets\nit so warm that it continues to keep warm\nduring the night. The ostrich is a lazy\nbird, anil like the alligator it shirks the\n\"setting\" business off on the.sun. In\nfact, there is no need of any bird \"set\nting\" on its eggs in the Tropical regions.\nCaptain Larkin tells me that he has\nhatched goose-eggs and hen's-eggs in the\nwarm sand.\n\"I place them just as the alligator\ndoes,\" said the Captain, \"where thev\nare continually warm, with the small\nend of the egg up and just sticking\nthrough the sand. I spread a blanket\nover them at night, and at the end of\nthree weeks the chickens jump out and\ncommence eating the musquitoes.\"\n\"Did you ever, vice versa, hatch\nalligator's eggs under a hen, Captain?\"\nI asked.\n\"No; but Mr. Pratt, the editor of the\nPalotka Herald, and Colonel Hart, who\nhas the big orange-grove over the river,\nhave done so, and ft was a very curious\nexperiment, too.\"\nA moment afterwards the Captain in\ntroduced me to Mr. Pratt. \"He is a very\ncareful and truthful man, etc.\" said the\nCaptain, \"and the best authority we have\non alligators.\"\n\"What was it about you and Colonel\nHart hatching alligator's eggs under a\nhen, Mr. Pratt?\" 1 asked.\n\"Why, yes, we tried it. We hatched\nI out two litters\u2014one under a goose, and\nI the other under an old hen. The goose\nstaid around the nest after the young\n'gators came, for some time. She was\nvery much puzzled. She couldn't give\ntip the idea that they were her goslings,\nbut still she didn't want to claim them.\nSo she'd.go to the nest and look in very\nmournfully, as men look at the re\nmains at a funeral, and then go away\nand think.\"\n\"Who fed the little alligators?\"\n\"O, little 'gators don't eat anything.\nThey will live for weeks on absolutely\nnothing. I've kept 'gators till they were\na foot long, and never given them any\nthing to eat. They simply lie still and\ngrow. Thev live on air.\"\n\"What did the old hen do?\"\n\"Well, she was different. She didn't\nact like the goose. She was a very stub\nborn old hen. I had tried to break her\nui). We'd tied her off the nest, ducked\nher in the water, and done everything to\nstop Iter setting; but she would set. So\n1 put ten 'gatflrs' eggs under her in the\nsand, and let her go at it. I thought\nshe'd get tired; but she sat five weeks on\nthose eggs, and finally they hatched out\nsix as lively little 'gators ns you ever saw.\nThe little fellows, you know, are quite\nfrolieky. I saw bv the looks of the old\nhen, the morning that the 'gators hatched\nout, that something was up. The old\nhen clucked in a slow, motherly way, as\nif she was very proud. I don't think\nshe'd seen the 'gators, though. Well,\nthe second day I threw some corn around\nthe old ben, and she came off to eat. I\nknew she wouldn't go back again if she\never saw the gators; but I wanted to see\njust what she would do. So Colonel\nHart and I watched the nest.\"\n\"Did she come back?\"\n\"Yes, and what do you think she did?\nWhy, she just clucked around the nest, as\nif it was the loveliest brood of white chick\nens on earth. Why, the old fool actually\nwent and sat down on the nest, and never\nnoticed the difference. I always knew\nhens were darned fools, but I never took\nthem for beastly idiots before. That hen\nsat on those little 'gators for four days,\ntill the little fellows began to crawl out\nof the nest and drop into the muddy wa\nter. And even then the old hen staid\naround, clucked to them, and tried to\nfeed them. Colonel Hart has three of\nthose 'gators now in his duck house, two\nyears old, and as gentle as kittens. They\ndo everything we tell them to. We are\ngoing to break them to the bit when they\nget about six years old, and use them to\ndraw the ferry-boat between the Larkin\nHouse and;Colonel Hart's orange-grove.\"\n\"And the old hen?\"\n\"Well, she's still around. She walks\naround the 'gators still and takes t mO.

She was black-haired,\ndark-eyed, pink-cheeked and the pos\nsessor of a deepdimple.\n\"Yon must come with us for a drive,\nMiss Faulkner, \" said Carrie, promptly.\n\"Croon, Maggie,\" said Mrs. Ransom.\nDick stepped down, and Msas Faulk\nner, with a laughing word of depreca\ntion, stepped up; then Dick drove on.\n\"Forgot the pickle recipe!\" Carrie\ncried.\nIt Dick could have laughed with\nthem! But he could not. His mood\nwas almost solemn. lie was not only\nstiff with embarrassment, but he was\nstartled. Had he ever seen her be\nfore? Where? It might have been in\nsome angelic vision.\nMiss Faulkner was charming as she\nturned to him, with a faint blush for\nthe oddity of the situation.\n\"I'm rather unconventional to come\nlike this,\" she declared to Dick. Jim\nand Carrie had settled back to a duet.\n\"'But I do love to drive.\"\n\"You do?\" said Dick.\nlie meant it to sound genial, but he\nknew it sounded stiff.\n\"I think the roads about here are\nbeautiful,\" said Miss Faulkner. \"But\nthe names you call them! I've heard\nof the crab road and the old cider mill\nroad.\"\n\"And the Josiah Ilinckley road,\"\nDick managed to add.\n\"I should think you'd call this the\nrick-rack road,\" she said, scanning li\u007f\nwinding length.\nDick laughed. If only the blood had\nnot gone tingling into his face the next\nminute! It was the sudden recollectioi\nthat Miss Faulkner had been twice to\nEurope which made it.\n\"Aunt Mary thinks there's no place\nlike Norwood,\" said Miss Faulkner,\nbrightly. \"It is very pretty.\"\n\"Not so very,\" said Dick.\nHer blue sash blew into his lap, and\nhe did not know what to do about it.\n\"But it is,\" said Miss Faulkner. \"Are\nthere mny. young peqple?\"\n\"Not very3many.\" said Dick.\n-. q\" wished Carrie and Jim would\nhelp- him .out, but they were fathoms\ndeep in Alow-toned dialogue.\n\"I think I should know,\" said Mliss\nFaulkner, whispering and sailng,\n\"that your sister was engaged, even if\nI hadn't heard it.\"\n\"\u007ft's plain enough,\" said Dick.\nIf she were not so stylish, so rich\nhadn't been abroad so frequently!\nAnd if he were not haunted by that\nqueer notion of having seen her before.\n\"If I didn't bring my book along!\"\nshe ejaculated, thumbing her hitherto\nforgotten pamphlet. \"A silly little\nthing I was reading in a hammock-a\nregular Lamm ock novel-'Molly's\nLovers.' Molly has six frantic lovers\nso far, and I'm expecting a seventh\nevery minute.\"\nWhy couldn't he think of something\nto rejoin? He should think of the right\nthing later, he knew. He flicked the\nhorse and thought of saying something\nabout the length of her visit, but that\nbrought to mind the imposing glories\nto which she would returnm. Rich,\nstylish, traveled, and Dick had never\nbeen farther than Farrington in his\nhonest, healthy life.\nBult he mustered courage for a des\nperate final effort\n\"Haven't I seen you before?\" he,\nsaid, rather bluntly.\n\"Mo? Where?\" said Miss Faulkser.\n\"That's what I don't know,\" he said\nlamely, \"but I thought-why-some\nhow-I don't know; I can't explain it.\nMaybe I never have.\"\nHe expected no reply to that stamn\nmering attempt, and got none, Miss\nFaulkner sat quiet, as though dii\naoumrged and exhausted at last And\nDick-poor Dickl He wished that he\nwas somewhere-anywhere else;U that\nbe knoew enough to say boo to a goose;\nthat he had nevei been born What\nmust she think of him?

Well, his m.erLy was\nstrangely complete. Half an herr. ago\nhe had been phlegmatically cerene.\nNow!\n\"Look!' Carrie cried, miraculously\nrousing herself. \"Wild roses! Jim, go\nand get some this instant-Dick, too.\nYou want some, don't you, M iss Faulk\nner?\"\n. \"Oh, yes!\" Mliss Faulkner cried, and\ntook the lines from Dick.\n\"You sahll- have all I can get,\"' he\nmurmured, anxiously.\nJim followed him, and Carrie fol\nlowed Jim.\n\"I know they'll overlook that pret\ntiest spray. Just for a minute, Miss\nV'utkuer,\" she said.\nIt was far more than a minute. The\nhorse gave a sudden plunge; though\neighteen years old and soberness itself,\nhe clung to the habits of youth. A\nwhite paper was driven under his\nsorrel nose by the wind, and the\n\" frightened animal gave a snort and\ngalloped down the ruead at high speed.\nThere was a turn not far away and\nDick had not recovered his breath be\nfore he saw the last flicker of Miss\nFaulkner's blue dress in a cloud of\ndust. The old horse flew round the\ncorner.\n\"She'll be killed!\" shrieked Carrie,\nwhile Jim stood petrified. J\nBut Dick swung into the road and\n'$a:n He had not been aware that such\npowers of swiftness lay in him.\nOf course she would be killed-or\nfearfully injured, at best. He should\nfind her lying somewhere-that'he was\nsure of But when? He had turned\nthe corner, but he could as yet see\nnothing. Row far he had run he didn't\nknow. It was nearly a mile. Small\nwonder.that when he did make out\nsomething ahead of him at last things\nwere s\u007fflmming before his eyes and\nhis head was buzzing. The object was\na person, and not a recumbent person,\neither. It was Miss Faulkner hurrying\ntoward him.\n- \"Mr. Corwin!\" she panted. \"Oh, did\nyou think I was killed? How absurd\nit was! Nothing but a nbwspaper.\nBut how you look! You've run all\nthe way!\"' She dropped down on the\ngrass and pulled him down beside her.\n\"I'm afraid you've almost killed your\nself,\" she cried. \"Do take off your\nbat and loosen your collar. You're\npurple!\"\n\"I'm all right.\" Dick gasped. \"It's\nyou. I thought 1 should find you lying\ndead somewhere. I saw your hat back\nthere.\"\n\u2022\"That came off, of course.\"\n\"I almost gave you up then.\"\nShe half pouted.\n\"Didn't you think I had. a bit of\nnerve to let myself be killed just by a\nfrightened horse? I just sat still and\nheld the lines with all my might and\nlet him run till he got tired. I was\nsure he would stop sometime. llc's up\nthere under that big maple. See him?\nI tied him to the post and ran back. I\nthought you'd be worried,\" she fin\nished, demurely.\n\"But you're plucky:\" cried Dick, his\nheart thumping a trifle less furiously.\n\"Why. not soawfully,\" said the girl,\nglancing at him half-frowningly. \"Any\nother line of conduct would have been\nstupid, you know. And why shouldn't\nI know something about horses? We\nhave one, and I drive all over Farring\nton every day.\"\n\"Farrington?\"\n\"Don't go back to monosyllables,\nDMr. Corwin. Yes, Farrington. Why\nnot? I've lived there nineteen years\nand three months\"\n\"In Farrington?\" said poor Dick,\ndazedly. \"My sister said you were\nfrom the city.\"\n\"Hardly. Farrington has only ten\nthousand inhabitants, you know. Is\nthat the reason you were afraid of\nme?\"\nShe lowered her mischievous eves.\n\"That and a few other things.\"\n\"What other things?\"\n\"My sister said she heard that you\nwere very rich, high and mighty, and\nbut if it had been true I ought not to\nhave acted like a fool. I'm bashful\nnaturally, Miss Faulkner, and I was\nabout rattled out of my wits. Oh, yes:\nI heard you had been to Europe twice.\"\nShe threw up both hands and her\npretty round chin.\n\"Europe! We went to the Thousand\nislands once, b::t we had to economize\nrather to do that. Father has a hard\nware store, and not such a very pros\nperous one, either. There! Am I can\ndid enough for you? Are you afraid of\nme still, Mr. Corwin?\"\nWhat was the matter with the blithe\ngirl? She was smiling, but her dark\neyes were misty. Dick did not know\nthen, but a tima came when he did.\nHe had felt the power of her delicate\nbeauty, her brightness, and there was\nan answering thrill in her own heart.\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said Dick.\n\"And I know now where I saw you\nbefore: it was in Farrington, a long\ntime ago, and I have never forgotten\nyou.\"\nAs he loosed at her she blushed and\nsmile| and it did not occur to them to\ndrive back till Jim and Carrie came in\nsight down the road.\nDick's shyness was not wholly eradi\ncated.

There are\nvarious methods of testing flour but\nthis is one of the simplest: Take some\nflour in the left hand, add a little wa\nter, and with the right forefinger mix\na rather stiff dough in the hand. Let\nit stand a few minutes, then knead and\nwork in the hand. If the flour is good\nthe dough will become stiffer and dryer\nwith working, and have an elastic, rub\nbery feeling. If it is of inferior quality\nthe dough will become soft and sticky\nunder protracted working. Flour that\nis of a chalky or bluish white shade, or\nthat feels soft and salvy, and when\nballed together in the hand remains in\na lump should be avoided:-Emma P.\nEwing, in the Chautauquan.\nA Bad Place to Edueate Children.\nThere is scarcely a worse school on\nearth for the education of the young\nthan that of the street.

Here, for in\nstante, they could see men riding huge\nsaurians across a lake without either\nreins or saddle; acme coming from the\ndepths of the oce n mounted on gigan\ntic turtles weigh g as much as Clydes\ndale horses, an others straddling a\njewfish, shark 4r porpoise or being\ntowed behind an enormous sea-devil in\na cockleshell of a boat or in a large\nschooner.\nThe announcement recently made in\na sensational New York journal that a\nman was navigating the maritime wat\ners of Florida mounted on a fourteen\nfoot alligator is not so impossible as\nsome persons mhy imagine. Yet I\ndoubt if it will ever be performed by\nthe present type of humanity and sau\nrian, for reasons that are self evident.\nTampa boasts of a colored citizen who\nhas no more fear of an alligator than he\nhas of the harmless lizard, and who\nwill attempt to ride one any day for a\nsmall sum of money. his method of\nriding the reptile is to enter a lake or\npond where the species congregate, se\nlect a large one, jump on its back\nquickly and, pressing his thumbs on its\neyes, urge it shoreward.\nAn employe of the South Florida rail\nroad, whose name I have received per\nmission to use, informed me that he\nhad often mounted old bulls in the\nlakes of Hernando county and ridden\nthem ashore without any trouble, by\nsimply pressing his thumbs on their\neyes and urging them forward with his\nheels or shouts He found it far easier\nto mount them than to dismount, for as\nsoon as his saurian steed touched the\nshore it tried to seize his leg by\nbringing its tail and head suddenly\ntogether and rolling over and over\nlike a barrel going down hill This is\nthe ordinary method employed by alli\ngators for capturing their prey or\nenemies, and as its efficacy depends on\nthe prompt conjunction of jaws and tail,\nthe stroke may be readily avoided by a\nlittle \"figuring,\" to use Mr. Stafford's\nexpression.\nAccording to \"sr. Stafford, all he had\nto do when in want of an aquatic mus\ntang was to enter a half-dried pond,\npick out the largest and laziest saurian\nhe saw there, mount it promptly and\npoint its head landward. The mounted\nanimal, according to his statement,\nmakes no fuss about moving wherever\nit is directed while in the water, but\nthe moment it touches land it uses\nevery effort to throw and devour its\njockey.\nIt is possible to ride an alligator some\ndistance overland by tying its muzzle,\nas it does not attempt to do any injury\nuntil it can throw its open mouth and\nlong tail together by a sudden sweep\nto one side. Mr. Stafford, who is, I\nbelieve, a native of Florida, a veteran\nhunter and an expert alligator jockey,\nrelates an anecdote which shows that\nsaurian riding is as dangerous as Irish\nsteeplechasing when the mount is\nsulky or wounded. ie had ridden an\nalligator ashore during one of his hunt\ning trips, and as it was rather large\nand its skin, as a consequence. unusu\nally valuable, he decided to kill and\nflay it near the pond.\nAfter emptying the contents of his\nrifle into its head and assuring himself\nof its being dead, he drew his knife to\nflay it; but he had hardly touched the\nhead ere the alligator returned to life\nwith a vigor that Lazarus never ap\nproached, and, seizing him by the coat\nsleeve, commenced rolling over and\nover.\nThe second or third roll took the\nsleeve off his coat and dislocated his\narm, and on being set free in this un\nexpected manner it did not take him\nlong to scramble out of reach of the\nfurious reptile. A physician who was\nhunting with him set his arm in a few\nmoments, and when that was done the\njockey poured lead into his late mount\nuntil he was sure that his ferocious\nspirit had fled to join its ancestors. A\nman who has shot alligators for their\nhides, told me that they were harmless\nin winter and inclined to avoid a contest\nwith man at all times unless they were\nwounded or defending their young.\nThey are worse in the pairing season\nthan at any other, the bulls being then\nunusually petulant, more than ordi\nnarily stupid and stubborn and inclined\nto resent any intrusion on their\ngrounds. Yet by boldly facing them\nthey can be forced to turn tail and run,\nand may even be mounted and ridden\nashore, provided there are no females\nin the vicinity.\nlie once tried to ride an old bull\ntowards a landmark that loomed above\nall other objects on the flat shore of a\nlake on a dark night, and wondered\nwhy his steed tried so hard to turn\naway from it whenever the thumb.\nwere lifted off the eyes, but he was\nable to account for it readily a few mo\nments later when an enraged female\nthat was guarding the landmark, which\nwas her nest, rushed open-mouthed\nand grunting like an insane grizzly at\nthem and sent her conqueror fleeing\nprecipitately to the rear and its jockey\ndeep into the mud.\nFortunately for him the assailant\nwasmore enraged at the bull than at\nthe jockey, and followed it several\nhundred yards charging at intervals\nand thrashing it vigorously with her\ntail whenever she got an opportunity.\nThe male was driven almost across the\nlake before she decided to return and\nattack the man, but he was running on\nshore for dear life long before she had\ngiven up the pursuit of the steed.\nThe rider said he had seen many\ndesperate charges during the civil war,\nbut that he never was in one that so\ncompletely benumbed his faculties as\nthe charge of that 'big-mouthed squaw\n'gator.\" Hle thought he could ride a\na male saurian at any time of the year,\nbut that no man living could retain his\nseat for any length of time on the back\nofa female that was defending her\nneet or was acompaoied by her young. I\ne once suaead\u007fl in kepling his cenat I\non the back of a female while she was\nhastening to her crying offspring, but\nwas thrown off the moment she reached\nthe month of the nest by a sudden\nsweep of her tail and and a downward\nmotion of her head.\nManaging to fall on his legs on hard\nsand, he attacked the reptile with his\nhunting knife and killed her before she\ncould inflict any Injury upon him, by\navoiding her rushes sad delivering his\nblows in her eyes ere she could get out\nof range. Having dispatohed her he\ncalled the young oat of their deep hole\nby imitating the grunting of the\nmother, and hadsixty of them in a sack\nin about as many minutes As he re\nceived ten dollars for the mother and\ntwenty-five cents each for her progeny\nhe concluded that his adventure had\npaid him very well.-St. Louis Re\npublic.\nREGARDING WITCHCRAFT.\nA Majority of the Cltlsees of the United\nstates Believe to It.\nWitchcraft Is at the present time be\nlieved in by a majority of the citizens\nof the United States. The larger num\nber of immigrants from the continent\nof Europe are more or less in fear of\nsuch powers To these must be added\nno Inconsiderable proportion of per\nsons of English and Sootch descent; for\na strong vein of superstition is discern\nible in many Irish, Scotch, and some\nEnglish, whose- \"folk-lore,\" diffused in\nnursery tales and neighborhood gosip,\nhas entwined itself strongly about the\nfibers of spontaneous subconscious\nmental imagery. Among the more\nignorant members of the Catholic\nchurch of every nationality the belief\nproduces a mysterious dread, against\nwhich men and women cross them\nselves, and resort to various rites sup\nposed to be efficaciot.\nWhere colonies of immigrants have\nremained isolated, retaining the use of\ntheir own language, the influence of\nwitchcraft is more easily traced. The\ninterior of Pennsylvania affords better\nillustrations of this, and on a larger\nscale, than any other state. It has been\nbut two or three years since suit was\nbrought by a man against his mother,\nin one of the counties of Pennsylvania,\nto recover damages for a dog which he\ncharged her with having killed by\nwitchcraft; and he not' only brought\nsuit, but obtained judgment from a\njustice of the peace. Variousswitnesses\ntestified as to their experiences in\nwitchcraft, and only one said that he\nhad never had a friend or relative who\nwas bewitched.\nIn divers villages in Pennsylvania,\nsome of them in the Dunkard settle\nment, are women who are supposed to\nbe witches. Some are shrewd enough\nnot to apply their arts for strangers,\nbut to those whom they know, as stated\nin an article in the New York Sun some\nyears ago, they will sell charms to ward\noff lightning from building, dry up\nthe wells of the enemies of applicants,\nforce cows to give bloody milk, cause\nsickness in the family, destroy beauty,\nseparate span and wife and reunite\nestranged lovers.\nIn the interior parts of the southern\nstates, where a large proportion of the\nwhite population can not read and there\nis little admixture of society, there are\n\"witch-doctors,\" who, assuming that\nall disease is caused by witches, se\ncure thriving practice in counteracting\ntheir influence. The Philadelphia\nTimes, on the authority of a reputable\ncorrespondent, who gives many facts\nto sustain his representations, says:\n\"For generations the poor whites have\nbelieved in witches, and the belief is\ndeep-seated and incurable.\"\nThe African population brought this\nbelief from the Dark Continent and it\npersists among them to this day, though\nthe progress of religion and education\nis doing something to check it.\nI have'recently noted in various parts\nof the United States more, than fifty\nsuits instituted by persons against\nthose who claimed had bewitched\nthem; but under existing laws the ac\ncused could not be prosecuted except\nwhere money had been obtained under\nfalse pretenses, or overt acts of crime\nhad been suggested or committed.\nDuring pedestrian tours in New Eng\nland, in various parts of the west, and\nin every southern state, I have fre\nquently stayed for the night at the\nhouses of poor farmers, laborers, fish\nermen and trappers. In such journeys\nI have invariably listened to the tales\nof the neighborhood, stimulating them\nby suggestion, and have found the be\nlief in witchcraft cropping out in the\noldest towns in New England. some\ntimes within the very shadow of the\nbuildings where a learned ministry has\nexisted from the settlement of the\ncountry and public schools have fur\nnished means of education to all\nclasses.

Melons, vegetables, fruits.\nfresh chickens, eggs, butter, meat or\nanything else a farmer may have, can\nbe sold on the streets without ques\ntion. The people of Lafayette are\nonly too glad to buy all sorts of\ncountry produce and will pay the best\nprices. The town affords a good mar\nket for all the produce that may be\nbrought in and our country friends\nshould feel no hesitancy in bringing\nin all good things they have to spare.\nThere is absolutely no license or fee\nof any kind and it is hard to conceive\nhow a report to this effect could have\ngained credence at all. It might be\nwell for the authorities to ascertain\nwho circulates these false reports aid\npunish the guilty ones.\nthe governor will have to call an ex\ntra session to repeal the law. The op\nposition, however, to the measure, it\nis not believed, is strong enough to\nprevent its passage, as the bill has\nthe backing of the New Orleans dele\ngation, the' New Orleans Board of\nTrade and Insurance Commissioner\nMcGivney.\nThe amendment which has been\ntacked onto the bill by the State com\nmittee provides 'that the insurance\ncompanies shall not have a voice in\nthe naming of one of the commission\ners, which makes the bill just a little\nharder than ever on the fire compa\nnies, so they claim.\nThe House of Representatives has a\nbig calendar, but has a great deal of\n\u2022its important work cleaned up.\nWoodmen Unveiling.\nThe local lodge WoOdmen of the\nWorld and the Abbeville lodge will\nhold unveiling ceremonies in Lafa\nyette jointly on July 24.

The'\nalligators Swan handles are not the\ngiants that bask in the mud of top-'\nIcal rivers, but the' are sufliciently.\nformidable nevertheless.\nIt is wonderful with what quickness'\nthese saurians can snap at a lana.\nSwan gave a little session with his\npets for the benefit of a correspond\nent of St. Nicholas and this quickness\nof action on the part of the alligatorsj\nwas fully demonstrated before the?\nlittle private performance ended.\nThe first task was to get the alliga\ntor into the open where the light was\nsufficiently good to permit of snap\nshots. This was done by two men\ngrasping the alligator, one seizing his\njaws with a lightning movemnent and\nthe other grabbing his wildly waving\ntail.\nIn the open the alligator proved as\nwicked as could have been wished.\nSwan's method of catching him was to:\nhold the hands in readiness and wait:\nfor a favorable chance to grab the up\nper and lower Jaws. As this was done\nwhile the formidable rows of teeth\nwere apparently aching for a chance\nto snap the man's arm, it was no\nsimple matter to catch the jaws and\nimprison them.\nSwan waited a long time before he\nsaw his chance and the eye could\nscarcely follow the movement of his\nhands as they were darted toward the.\noutstretched jaws. Once the jaws'\nwere closed in the man's vise-like grip\nit was a simple matter to slip one,\nhand under the snout, seize one of the\nclawing legs with the other and turn;\nthe alligator on his back.\nThe owner of the alligator says he:\nhas found a way to hypnotize the crea\ntures. Be that as it may, it is true!\nthat he made the wicked little saurian!\nlie perfectly still for as long a time as!\nhe wished and then raised him in hisi\narms and carried him around like a'\nbaby, the animal being apparently!\nsound asleep all the time. When\nSwan put him down and touched his\nt~hroat with a finger he awoke onceo\nmore into vicious life and began snap-f\nping as before.\nThe alligator cannot move very\nquickly on his legs and it is easy\nenough to avoid him when he comest\nat you, bdt to try and pinion his jaws\nis another matter and a task that-no'\nohe would care to try unless gifted\nwith lightning-like agility and they\nquickest of eyes, as well as with mum:\nlar . hands.\nRainbow Dyes contain no acid and\nfor that reason can be used on the\nmost delicate piece of chiffon or\nlace without any possibiltiy of injur\ning it.

M'Cann Tells of Sport\non the Caloosahatchee J*\nL - -J\nWOULD like to tell you about\n^ hunting the Caloosahatchee ra\nzorbaek,\" said Col. Joe McCann, of the\nIron Mountain route. \"To begin with,\nI'll tell you that 1 once saw a woman\nin Missouri using the side of a razor\nback hog as a washboard, rasping the\nclothes on it as on the corrugated sur\nface of a real store washboard. The\nrib contour of the razorback was ably\nfitted for the purpose.\n\"I thought that hog was about as\nthin as anything had a right to be,\nbut I changed my mind when, down in\nthe Caloosahatchee country, I saw\nthat to keep razorbacks from getting\ninto the gardens, between the pickets\nof the fences, they had to tie them to\ngether in pairs, side by side, and even\nthen had sometimes to set the pickets\na little closer to one another.\n\"The fattest razorback I ever saw in\nthe Caloosahatchee country stood four\nfeet perpendicular, and had a horizon\ntal spread of five feet ten inches. As\nto his thickness, you may judge when I\ntell you that he fell through a four\ninch crack in the mow of a haysl\u00efed,\nwhere he had climbed to rob a hen's\nnest, and never rumpled a hair.\n\"That pig 1 subsequently saw killed,\nlie tipped the scales at 47 pounds and\nthree ounces\u2014the fattest pig, they\nsaid, that had been bagged along the\nCaloosahatchee in many a day.\n\"There isn't so much sport, though,\nin hunting the Caloosahatchee razor\nback. It is when they hunt you that\nthe excitement comes in. They forage\nin the woods on the wild oranges, and\nthe best way to get your razorback\nis to preempt a crop of these wild or\nanges, as it lies on the ground where\nit has fallen from the tree, and squat\nthereuntil the razorback comes along.\n\"The minute he sees you he will start\nin to replevin that orange crop by\ncharging on you. lie may rot. chase\nyou more than half a mile, but if a\nstraightaway run ahead of him seems\nmonotonous, you may vary it and get\nmore fun out of it by dodging around\namong the trees. This winding trail\nwill keep you within easy distance\nof the orange crop, to which the razor\nback will return when he concludes\nthat he has scared you enough to keep\nyou away.\n\"If your wind isn't good, or your\nheels are not active enough for you to\nenjoy that part of the chase, climb a\ntree. It seems to please a Caloosa\nhatchee razorback immensely if he can\ntree you, and he will return to the or\nanges grunting his unmistakable sat\nisfaction. no matter if the tree you\nhave shinned up isn't more than 20\nyards away.\n\"Assoon as the razorback has chased\nyou to his satisfaction, or has treed\nyou, he will go right back and start\nin on getting away with that orange\ncrop, and then you can join him and\nbag him, for when he once begins to\neat wild oranges he pays no attention\nto anything else nr anybody.\n\"You might ask why you don't haul\nup and shoot the razorback on the go\nin. without letting him hunt you all\nover the woods and follow your trail\nor tree you. before you make an effort\nto gather him in. I'll tell you why:\n\"Caloi sahatehee, you know, is down\nin Florida. The way I came to be\nthrown into the society of the Caloosa\nhatchee razorback was that when I\nwent to Florida one time a friend of\nmine said to me that of course I would\nwant to get some alligators.\n\"'Goto the Caloosahatchee for your\nalligators,' said he. 'And stop with\nCapt. Dave Corey.'\n\"I did so. The first meal I sat down\nto at Capt. Dave Corey's I noticed a\nheap of thin, ribbon-like strips of\nsomething on a dish. They were of a\ndeep, bright ultramarine blue.\n\" 'Some of the poke, sah?' said Capt.\nDave.\n\"I said I would have some of the\npork, and when he served me with half\na dozen or so of the dark blue ribbons\nI was startled.\n\" 'Is this pork, captain?' said I.\n\" 'Sho'ly!' he replied. 'Prime poke.\nThat poke won't fade, sah. It's fast :\ncolor. Yo' see, sah, the razorbacks\nthey eat the wild oranges to give 'em ;\nthe proper shade and flavor, and they |\neat the marsh grass roots to give 'em\nthe fat, sah.'\n\"But I found that it was color that\nruled In the quality of Caloosahatchee\npork Prime razorback is not only blue\nwhen killed, but will remain so, and can\nbe warranted fast color. Inferior ra\nzorbaek, though, will fade and get to\nbe a rusty yellow.\nAfter dinner I said to Capt. Dave\nthat I guessed I would go over to the\nbayou and bag an alligator or two, but\nhe said that the razorbacks were div\ning in the bayous at that time of day\nafter marsh grass roots, and that\nwhen ihe razorbacks were diving the\nalligators laid mighty low. I hadn't\nseen any Caloosahatchee razorbacks\nyet, so I gave little thought to this\nintelligence about them, and took my\nrifle and strolled over to the bayou, a\nmile distant.\nT sat down on a log to watch for an\nalligator to come out and sun himself.\nBv and by I saw something rising to\nthe surface, and at last a long upper\njaw appeared. It was of tremendous\nlength, and I thought I was soon to\ncapture a prize alligator. But greater\nexposure of the supposed prize showed\nme not an alligator at all, but a great,\ngaunt beast, and I needed no one to\ntell me was a Caloosahatchee razor\nback. He gave a couple of snorts, and\nthen went down out of sight again as\nhandy as a turtle.\n\"He was down at least ten minutes.\nThen he came up and swam ashore. He\nlanded about 50 yards from where I\nsat.\n\"Thinking that here would be a\ntrophy better yet than an alligator, I\ntook good aim and fired at him. I\nheard mj r bullet strike the hog like\nchucking a stone against a fence. He\nraised his head and looked up as if he\nthought he might have felt something,\nbut wasn't quite sure.\n\"I banged away again. I heard the\ni second bullet plink against that razor\n! back as plain as anything, but he didn't\nj seem to be a bit more disconcerted\nthan he was before. I was on the\npoint of sending another bullet against\nhim, when Capt. Dave came out of the\nreeds off to my left.\n\"'Ef yere practicin' for a target,\nsah,' said he, 'yo' better plink yore bul\nlets ag'in the yon side of the hog, sah,\nso they'll shy off into the river, kaze\nI'm work-in' on this side, sah, and\nthey're shyin' mighty close to me, sah.'\n\"My bullets had been caroming off\nthat razorback's hide like billiard balls\noff a cushion, and one of them had\nshied through the crown of Capt.\nDave's hat.\nNEITHER FEAR NOR FAVOR.\nAn Amusing Example of Indepen\ndence of Spirit of Cbarles\nLever, Noveliat.\nA tactful refusal is sometimes hard\nto compass; yet a \"no\" may contain a\nspicier savor than many an assent.\nThere is a story of Archbishop Whate\nly, who was walking in a London city\npark one day with the curate an\u00a3\nCharles Lever, the novelist, says\nYouth's Companion.\nThe archbishop was greatly interest\ned in mushrooms, and he picked one\nand ate a piece of it, at the same time\nhanding a bit to the curate.\nWhat do you think of that, Mr. A.?\"\nhe asked.\nThe curate did not especially like it,\nand moreover he was not sure wheth\ner it could be safely eaten.

Dave told me to go out and pass\na bullet into his head, 'by way of the\ninside of his ear, sah.'\n\"I went out, shoved my rifle in the\nrazorback's ear and fired.

He rose and started\nfor the hay shed to see about that egg.\n\"He got as far as the door, glanced\nup at the ladder that led to the mow\nand then changed his mind.

T. DeWitt Talmage\nHis Aetit/e Dife. His Sermons for JVIany Years\nPublished meekly in Hundreds of Papers\nin This and Other Countries.\nJO\nW\nREV. T. DEWITT TALMAGE, D. D.\nOne of the world's greatest preach\ners has passed away. Rev. T. De Witt\nTalmage, having devoted his life and\nw-onderful talents to the pointing of\nothers to the way of eternal life, has\nat last himself stepped over into the\nlarger, fuller life of God's eternal day.\nThe tenement house of clay has been\ngiven up for the one not made with\nhands, eternal in the heavens. The\nglories of the future home of the\nsou], which has been so often elo\nquently and graphically portrayed by\nDr. Talmage in his sermons, has burst\nupon his vision as he sees face to\nface and realizes the force of the\nScripture which his lips have spoken\nso many times: \"Eye hath not seen,\nnor ear heard, neither have entered\ninto the heart of man the things\nwhich God hath prepared for them\nthat love Him.\"\nDeath has been swallowed up in\nvictory. As he fell asleep in Jesus\nand awoke in His likeness, this\nvaliant soldier of the Lord Jesus\nChrist could exclaim in ringing tones\nof triumph: \"0 death, where is thy\nsting? O grave, where is thy vic\ntory?\" And as he passed on into the\npresence of his King and Saviour, the\nminor strain of the words: \"The\nsting of death is sin; and the\nstrength of sin is the law\" have been\nlost in the mighty chorus of the re\ndeemed with which his voice has\nmingled as they sing: \"But thanks\nbe to God, which giveth us the vic\ntory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\"\nDr. Talmage was a firm believer in\nthe Bible as the Word of God. The\nhigher criticism could never shake his\nfaith in the realities of all the Bible\nset forth. He frequently declared\nthat he believed every jot and tittle\nof it between the covers of the book,\nevery word of it as it stands. And it\nwas because of this that his preach\ning was so vivid and forceful. He be\nlieved what he spoke. Did he speak\nof hell, he painted it as a reality\nand made his hearers believe that\nwhen the Bible talked about hell it\nmeant exactly what it said. Did he\nundertake to set forth the realities\nof heaven, his graphic portrayal of\nScriptural passages on the subject\ncarried his hearers up to the very\ngates until they could almost see the\nwhite robed throngs passing through\nthe golden streets. The pictures\nwhich he drew at times were start\nling. and his illustrations striking and\nforcible. Bible characters as he\ntai'ked about them became living\nrealities and that vagueness which\ngenerally surrounds sacred history in\nthe minds of people was lifted, and\nMoses and Elijah, Daniel and David,\nand the others in the long list of\nBible heroes stood out with a vivid\nness that held the wrapt attention of\nhis hearers and the readers of his\nsermons.\nHe -was dramatic and sensational in\nhis manner in the pulpit, but always\nwith the purpose of emphasizing the\nmessage he was delivering. On one\ni occasion, when it was time for him\n! to begin his sermon, he went to the\nedge of the platform, buttoned hi*\ncoat, raised hi* arm* and wheeling\nsuddenly about dashed in running\njumps across the platform, his arms\nwaving like the sails of a windmill,\nhis coat-tails flying behind him, and\nhis trousers working above his shoe\ntops.\nHe had not spoken a word, and\nsome of his congregation were ready\nto shriek, not knowing what to make\nof it, when Mr. Talmage stopped\nshort, turned and walked back to the\ncenter of the platform and ex\nclaimed, as the beginning of his ser\nmon: \"l'oung man, you're rushing\nto destruction!\" And amidst the pro\nfound impression he had created he\npreached powerfully of the dangers\nof city life to young men who yielded\nto temptation, and made them real\nize that they stood on the very brink\nof hell.\nDr. Talmage did not belong to a\nclass. He was a type by himself. His\nsermons were unique. His comment\non his style of preaching was: \"My\npositive mode of preaching seems to\nstir the hostilities of all earth and\nhell.\" In telling the story of his\nlife he once said:\n\"Feeling called upon 15 years ago\nto explore underground New Y T ork\ncity life, that I might report the\nevils to be combatted, I took with\nme two elders of my church and a\nNew- York police commissioner and a\npoliceman, and I explored and report\ned the horrors that needed removal\nand the allurements that endangered\nour young men. There came upon\nme an outburst of assumed indigna\ntion that frightened almost every\nbody but myself. That exploration\nput into my church 30 or 40 newspa\nper correspondents, from the north,\nsouth, east and west; which opened\nfor me new avenues in which to\npreach the Gospel that otherwise\nwould never have been opened.\nY\"ears passed on and I preached a\nseries of sermons on amusements,\nand a false report of what T did say\nroused a violence that threatened me\nwith poison and dirk and pistol and\nother forms of extinguishment, until\nthe chief of the Brooklyn police,\nwithout any suggestion from me,\ntook possession of the church with\n24 policemen to see that no harm\nwas done.\"\nDr. Talmage is said to have reached\na far greater number of people with\nhis sermons than any other preach\ner. The sermons he delivered to his\ncongregation on Sunday appeared\nMonday morning in a syndicate of\npapers in this and other countries,\nand through these channels it is es\ntimated that they reached 50.000.000\nreaders. He also made his influence\nfelt as editor of the Christian Herald\nand as a constant contributor to\nnumerous periodicals, and was a\nvoluminous writer of books. He\nedited the Christian at Work from\n1873 to 1876; the Advance of Chicago\nin 1877 and 1878 and more recently\nFrank Leslie's Sunday Magazine.\nAmong his writings were the fol\nlowing: \"Crnmbs Swept Up.\" 1870;\nfour volumes of sermons. 1872-1875;\n\"Abominations of Modern Society,\"\n1972; \"Old Welis Dug Out,\" 1S74;\na\na\na\nof\nto\na\nHe\n\"Sports that Kill,\" 1875; \"Night Side*\nof City Life,\" 1878; \"The Brooklya\nTabernacle, a Collection of 104 Ser\nmons,\" 1884; \"The Marriage Ring,\"\n1886.\nAmong his lectures the more prom\ninent were the ones on the Holy Land\nand Athens, the material for which he\ngathered on his travels. The Univer\nsity of New York conferred on him\nthe degree of A. M. in 1862, and he re\nceived that of D. D. from the Univer\nsity of Tennessee in 1884.\nThis busy, helpful, noble life of serv\nice was begun at Bound Brook, N. J.,\nin 1832. He was the youngest of 12\nchildren, five girls and seven boys. His\nfather, David T. Talmage, was a farm\ner and well known for his decision of\ncharacter and good humor, while his\nmother coupled keen wit with marked\namiability, traits which found a happy\ncombination in the boy who was des\ntined to fill the world with the sound\nof his powerful preaching.\nWhen he was 18 years of age Dr. Tal\nmage entered the University of New\nYork cityq but did not complete the\ncourse there, taking up instead the\nstudy of law. Not long after this he\ndetermined to enter the ministry, *\ncalling which two of his uncles, a\nbrother-in-law and three brothers\nwere following, and in later years Dr.\nTalmage was gratified to see his own\nson Frank enter the ministry,and he is\nat the present time filling a suc\ncessful pastorate at Chicago. Mr.\nTalmage completed his theological\ntraining at the New Brunswick theo\nlogical seminary in 1856.\nHe became pastor of the Reformed\nDutch church in Belleville, N. J.\nLater he went to Syracuse, and while\nholding a pastorate there he married\nhis first wife, Miss Avery, of Brook\nlyn. Soon after he went to Philadel\nphia as pastor of the Second Reformed\nDutch church, where he remained\nseven years. While in Philadelphia\nDr. Talmage received three calls at\nonce, to Chicago, San Francisco and\nBrooklyn. His fame as a pulpit orator\nhad spread wide, and power to attract\nworshipers to his church brought de\nmands for his services from many\nplaces. It was in 1869 that he accept\ned the call to the Central Presbyterian\nchurch of Brooklyn, N. Y.\nDr. Talmage preached in the old\nchurch in Brooklyn for 15 months and\nthen the congregation and member\nship outgrew the sanctuary. The or\nganization therefore decided to build\nthe first Brooklyn tabernacle. It was\nin the form of a horseshoe and in\nclosed half an acre. It was burned\nin 1872, after standing two years, dur\ning which time the 3,400 seats proving\ninadequate the capacity of the build\ning was increased 500 more. Work was\nat. once begun on a new tabernacle,\nwhich was dedicated February 22,1874,\nwith seats for 5,000 persons. It was\nthen the largest Protestant church in\nAmerica. After the church edifice had\nburned for the third time, in 1889, Dr.\nTalmage resigned his pastorate of\n25 years, not asking his congregation\nto build a fourth time. In 1894 he ac\ncepted a call to the pastorate of the\nFirst Presbyterian church in Washing\nton, D. C., and had made his home in\nthat city up to the time of his death.\nDr. Talmage's first wife was\ndrowned in the Schuylkill river during\nhis Philadelphia pastorate, and two\nyears later he married again, his wife\nbeing Miss Susan C. Whittemore, of\nBrooklyn, by whom he had several chil\ndren. Two children, a boy and girl,\nwere born to him of his first marriage.\nWith the impressive funeral services\nin the Church of the Covenant at\nWashington and the interment of the\nremains in the family plot at Brook\nlyn, passes from the activities of the\nearth life one of the greatest factors\nin the religious forces of the past\ncentury, but his words and his deeds\nlive on. Like the ripples spreading out\nin ever-widening circle, the influence\non the lives of the thousands who\nheard and read his sermons will con\ntinue and Talmage, the great preacher,\nthough dead, will continue to speak.\nWILLIS S. EDSON.\nSacrlflelnc Men to Principles.\nThat principles live although men\ndie is a truism that may be expressed\nin another way, even if it takes consid\nerable frankness to say it. It is re\ncalled by a gentleman that his father\nwas once traveling with Wendell Phil\nlips, and took occasion to speak with\nsome bitterness of the harsh treat\nment that had been accorded to Gen.\nBanks by certain citizens of Boston.\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Phillips, with charm\ning ingenuousness. \"When we want to\nestablish a principle we do not hesi\ntate to sacrifice a man to it.\"\u2014Youth'*\nCompanion.\nSiberia has evidently not been abol\nished as a penal colony. Reports from\nSt. Petersburg show that many stu\ndents who were engaged in the recent\ndemonstration have been exiled to Si\nberia, though for only short terms.\nNicholas II., it was said a year or two\nago, had stopped sending prisoners to\nSiberia. The running of the railroad*\nthrough that continent, however, will\nultimately do more than the ukase of\nczars could toward knocking the penal\ncolony obsolete. It was isolation that\nmade Siberia a stowing-away place for\nthe dangerous persons of Russia.\nAn injury to the tongue is repaired\nby nature with more rapidity than ia\nthe case with any other paft of tbt\nsystem,", "batch": "lu_ninetails_ver01", "title_normal": "bossier banner.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85034235/1902-05-22/ed-1/seq-1.json", "place": ["Louisiana--Bossier--Bellevue", "Louisiana--Bossier--Benton"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 1, "county": ["Saint Tammany"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Weekly", "id": "/lccn/sn82015387/1915-04-24/ed-1/seq-1/", "subject": ["Covington (La.)--Newspapers.", "Louisiana--Covington.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01208117", "Louisiana--Saint Tammany Parish.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01207373", "Saint Tammany Parish (La.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Covington"], "date": "19150424", "title": "St. Tammany farmer.

Planche, returned to Cov\nington last week after a visit to\nFrance, where he had gone with The\nintention of serving in the French\narmy. The Planche family is well\nknown here, there being several\nbranches engaged in business, and\nthey all love France and have in her\nthat abounding faith that changes\nsolicitude into an eagerness for con\nquest. Therefore when last July\nChristia Baptiste announced his de\ntermination to give his services to the\ncause of France, his relatives bade\nhim good-bye with pride in his spirit\nand a hopeful prayer that he might\nbe spared to return to them. It\nseems, however, that Mr. Baptiste's\ncourage and desire exceeded the re\nquired physical condition for service\nin the French army, He had receiv\ned an injury to his leg while former\nly in the service which caused him to\nbe rejected, and he left Bordeaux for\nNew York on his return trip April\n3, reaching here April 17.\nMr. Baptiste says the people of\nFrance h ve every confidence of final\nvictory; that after the battle of\nMarne, Germany offered France Al\nsace and Lorraine if she would with\ndraw from the conflict; that the ap\nFire Destroys\nHouse at Ramsay\nA residence of the St. Tammany\nLumber and Manufacturing Co., at\nRamsay, was destroyed by fire last\nSaturday, The roof of an adjoining\nbuilding was also burned before the\nstream poured upon it by the mill\nfire-fighting apparatus put it out.\nThe loss was about $1400.

Be it ordained by the\nTown Council of the town of Coving\nton, in legal session convened, That\nthe front doors of all houses of pros\ntitution within what is commonly\nknown as the Restricted Distric' in\nthe town of Covington, shall be kept\nclosed by the person or persons op\nerating or conducting the same.\nSection 2. Be it further enacted,\nThat all inmates of houses of pros\ntitution within said district be and\nare hereby prohibited from walking\nor riding with men in the day or\nnight time on the public streets or\nsidewalks outside of said restricted\ndistrict; and further prohibited from\nwhat is commonly known as \"joy\nriding\" with or without men on the\npublic streets outside of said dis\ntrict.\nSection 3. Be it further enacted,\nThat the inmates of such houses of\nprostitution are hereby prohibited\nfrom appearing on any public street\nor side-walk, or within plain view of\nthe same, except when dressed in\nrespectable attire; and are further\nprohibited from appearing on the\nfront steps, verandas, or at the win\ndows or doors of said houses of pros\ntitution, unless decently attired.\nSection 4. Be it further enacted,\nThat whoever shall violate any of the\nprovisions of this ordinance shall.\nupon trial and conviction thereof, be\nfined not more than $50.00, or im\nprisonment not more than 10 days, or\nboth, at the discretion of the Mayor.\nCarried.\nOn motion, duly seconded, same\n(Continued on page 6)\nthe risks that are taken; but in the\nstillness of a quiet ocean, when the\nsharp prow of the vessel cleaves the\nwater, and the soft swish of the\nwaves whisper a lullaby and the onl;\nlight is the rays from the twinkling\nstars of a midnight sky, an open\neyed dream of mines and torpedoes\nand submarines is apt to rival the\nnightmare of the sound sleep that\nfollows the org'es of the midnight\noil.\n\"I did not see any great suffering\nin France. It is true that in some\ninstances women were doing the\nwork on the farms that men had\ndone before, but in commercial life\nthere was none of the substitution\nof women for men that I have seen\naccredited to Germany. Outside of\nthe fact that bread was a little high\ner, provisions were as plentiful and\nas cheap as usual. Yet while I was\nnot near enough the front to see the\nactual horrors of war, I knew what\nwas taking place and I realized the\ndangers of a vessel at sea amidst the\nwatchfulness of nations at war. The\npeacefulness around and aboard ship\nseemed to tell of the calm that pre\ncedes the storm. Notwithstanding,'\nwe had a pleasant trip. The near\nest we came to any signs of trouble\nwas the passing of one of the cruisers\na few miles from New York, that was\nsupposed to have been watching for\nPrinz Eitel Friederich to make hzer\nbreak for open sea.\"\n\"I am glad to be home again,\"\nsaid Mr. Baptiste, \" and to meet my\nold friends. Covington is very dear\nto me.\"\ning excavated for her especial use\nand comfort. Nine baby alligators\nhad already been captured and were\nin the pen when the big one, which\nis a female, was put in. As they\nwere caught in the same neighbor\nhood, it is not improbable that the\nmaternal instinct that allowed the\nlittle ones to crawl over her back\nand even into her open mouth was a\nnatural demonstration of motehrly\naffection.\nMr. Treadway caught this saurian\nspeciment in the marsh ying be\ntween Bayou Lacombe and Bonfouca.\nIt was in about four feet of water.\nHe used a twenty foot pole to oust\nher from her resting place, and as\nshe came towards him he grasped\nher jaws in his hands and beat her\nover the nose with a rope end. This\nis his method of subduing alligators,\nand is said to make them quiet and\ninoffensive. He then tied her, and\nthe J b was done, all except the\ntrans ortation. Any ore can see her\nat the New Southern Hotel, if Gabe\ndoes not take a notion to serve alli\ngator steaks. Her weight is 483\npoulda.\nKING'S DAUGHTERS AND\nSONS CONVENTION MEETS\nIN COVINGTON THIS WEEK\nThe King's Daughters and Sons\nConvention is being held at Bogue\nFalaya Park pavilion. It would\nbe hard to find! a more suita,ble\nplace for a convention of this kind,\nas it is almost like being in the\nopen air. Mr. John Haller has\nused his usual good ta.ste in the\nvery pretty decorations. Long\nstreamers of I.urple and white,\nthe colors of the order, are over\nhead and evergreens are neatly ar\nranged about the building. The\nbanisters of the steps leading to\nthe stage are of curly birch with\nclinging vines, giving a unique\nand rustic effect that is very pleas\ning. Back of the stage is a per\ngola dressed in conlbinations of\npurple and white morning glories\nand evergreens. But the greatest\nattraction of all is the openness of\nthe pavilion to the sweet-smelling\nair of the springtime woods that\nis wafted freely through the bud\nding trees and shrubbery. Mrs. J.\nC. Burns was on guard as usual\nThursday, planning for arrange\nments and supervising generally.\nLuncheon will be served to-day\non the open grounds, provision t\nhaving been made for three hun\ndred guests.

When thoughts\nOf the last bitter hour come like a blight\nOver thy spirit, and sad images\n01 the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,\nAnd breathless darkness, and the narrow house,\nMake thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;\nGo forth, unto the open sky, and list\nTo nature's teachings, while from all around\nEarth and her waters, and the depth of air\nComes a still voice-Yet a few days, and thee\nThe all beholding sun shall see no more\nIn all her course; nor yet in the cold ground,\nWhere thy pale form was laid, with many tears,\nNor in the embrace of ocean. shall exist\nThy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall\nclaim\nThy growth, to be resolved to earth again,\nAnd, lost each human trace, surrendering up\nThine individual being, shalt thou go\nTo mix for ever with the elements,\nTo be a brother to the insensible rock\nAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain\nTurns with his share. and treads upon. The oak\nShall send his roots abroad. audqierce thy mould.\nYet not to thine eternal resting place\nShalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish\nCouch more Magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\nWith patriarchs of the infant world-with kings,\nThe powerful of the earth-the wise, the good,\nFair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,\nAll in one mighty sepulcbre. The hills\nRock-ribbed and ancient as the sun -the vales\nStretching in pensive quif'tness between\nThe venerable woods-rivers that move\nIn majesty. and the complaining brooks\nThat make the meadows green ; and, poured\nround all,\nOld ocean's gray and melancholy waste\nAre but the solemn decorations all\nOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\nThe plants, all the infinite host of heaven,\nAre shining on the sad abodes of death\nThrough the still lapse of ages. All that tread\nThe globe are but a handful to the tribes\nThat slumber in its bosom. Take the wings\nOf morning, and the Barcan desert pierce,\nOr lose thyself in the continuous woods\nWhere rolls the Oregon. and hears no sound,\nSave his own dashings-yet-the dead are there;\nAnd millions in those solitudes, since first\nThe flight of years began, have laid them down\nIn their last sleep-the dead reign there alone.\nSo shalt thou rest, and what if thou shalt fall\nUnnoticed by the living. and no friend\nTake note of thy departure? All that breathe]\nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\nPlod on, and each one as before will chase\nHis favorite phantom ; yet all these shall leave\nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall\ncome\nAnd make their beds with thee. As the long\ntrain\nOf ages glides away, the sons of men,\nThe youth in life's green spring, aitw he who goes\nIn the full strength of years-matron, and maid,\nAnd the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man\nShall one by one be gathered to thy side,\nBy those, who in their turn shall follow them.\nSo live, that when thy summons comes to join\nThe innumerable caravan, which moves\nTo the pale realms of shade, where each shall\ntake\nHis chamber in the silent halls of death,\nThou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,\nScourged to his dungeon, but sustained and\nsoothed\nLike one who wraps the drapery of his couch\nAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\nTHE EMPERoR's DANGER.-Of the first\nattempt to assassinate Emperor William,\na Berlin letter writer says-of the effect\nupon the people, and its cause:\n-'While the escape of the emperor does\nnot lessen the indignation of the people, it\nrenders them calmer and better able to\nappreciate the significance of the incident,\nand the result is a feeling of serious un\neasiness and anxiety. The event opens\nout a vision of possibilities which had\nhardly been considered, and which are\nappalling. I have never known Berlin so\ngrave, and even depressed as at this\nabrupt and startling summons to prepare\nfor unseen and terrible dangers, to resist\na foe whom want, hatred and sentimeut\ncan apparently drive to the point of des\nperation. It does not seem to be believed\nthat Hode! had accomplices, or that any\ngeneral plot existed. His act was appa\nrently his own, but the socialist papers\nfound on his person, his known connection\nwith Social Democrats at Leipsic, and the\nstyle of his self-justification before the\noilicers, leave little doubt that he is the\nproduct of revolutionary sopisin, wok.\ning upon a mind full of sentiment and\nPolitical Assassinations.\nA Thirty/ Years' Record in Europe and\nAmerica of Attempts on the Lives of\nRultrs\n[Translated for the N.

'Is\nit wha'es?\" said Pat. \"Sure we may see'm\nby the dzon, spouting about like water\nengines all over the place.\" \"Are there\nmany dog fish?\" was the next question.\n'Docs, begorra! ye'd say so, had ye pass\ned the night here. Strs we can't sle p\nfor the baikin' o' thim.\" \"Do flying fish\nabound here?\" inquired another g ntle\nman. \"Flying-fish, is it?\" quoth the vera\nc ous fellow. \"If we didn't put up the\nshutters over night, there wouldn't be a\nwhole pane o' glass in the house for the\ncraters batin' against thim !\" When he\nCaine up for his expenses, Pat tried to coax\nsomething extra out of the commissioners,\non the plea that he had sworn to every\nthing their honors \"axed\" him. Nothing\npleases your fun-loving Irishman better\nthan to bother a lawyer, and the Irish\ncourts have known many a dialogue like\nthis: \"You are a Roman Catholic ?\" \"Ara\nI?\" \"Are you not ?\" \"You say I am.\"\n\"Come, sir; what's your religion!\" \"The\ntrue religion.\" \"What religion's that ?\"\n\"My religion,\" \"And what is your reli\ngion ?\" \"My mother's religion.\" \"What\nwas your mother's religion !\" \"She tuk\nwhisky in her tay.\" 'You bless yourself.\ndon't you?\" \"When I'm done with you, I\nwill.\" \"What place of worship do you\ngo to ?\" \"The most convenient.\" \"Of\nwhat persuasion are you?\" \"My persuasion\nis that you won't find out.\" \"What is\nyour belief?\" \"That you are puzzled.\"\n\"Do you confess ?\" \"Not to you.\" \"Who\nwould you write to if you were likely to\ndie?\" \"The doctor.\" \"I insist upon.your\nanswering me, sir. Are you a Roman\nCatholic?\" \"I am.\" \"And why didn't\nyou say so at once ?\" \"You never axed\nme. You said I was a great many things,\nbut you never axed me; you were drivin'\ncross words and crooked questions at me,\nand I thought it was manners to cut my\nbehavior on your own pathern.\"\nCROCODILES.-The difference between\na crocodile and an alligator is thus set\nforth by one who evidently knows where\nof he speaks: \"11 know the alligator as I\nknow buffalo, and the Nile saurian is no\nmore like the South American alligator\nthan a subsidized, bargain-hunting mis\nsionary is like a sincere Christian. The\nreptiles before us were from fifteen to\neighteen feet long, sandy-yellow in color,\nnot all black, thicker and shorter in the\nhead than the alligator, and so supple and\nlithe as to turn themselves almost double\nwhen alarmed, with the ease of an acro\nbat. The alligator when turning moves\nthe whole body. The Nile crocodile is\nalways a dangerous antagonist. The alli\ngator in the Southern swamps is, at best,\nsport for convalescents and boys in Flori\nda. Even in his native element the alli\ngator will flee at the approach of man,\nwhereas I am told by the native hunter\nthat in the water the crocodile invariably\nattacks, deeming himself its mightiest\ninhabitant.\nTHE MARSEILLAISE.-The words and\nmusic of the \"Marseillaise\" have been at.\ntributed to a certain Rouget de Lille. He\nis said to have been born in 1760, and to\nhave been the son of a lawyer.gIn April,\n1792, so runs the story, just after, the\nFrench had declared war against the Aus\ntrians, De Lille happened to be in a garri\nson at Strasburg. The mayor of the town\ninvited him to dinner. The conversation\nchanced on millitary matters, and Do Lille,\nwho was known to have a turn for music\nand poetry, was asked to compose some\nth n snitah!e for the political occasion.\nD, Lille, excit, d by the dinner, and com\nplImented by the demand, took his fiddle,\nMs soon as he reached hIs quarters, and pro\nduced what Ul bach calla \"the eternal poe m\nof the great apogee of the Revolution.\" It\nwas originally known as the 'Ilymne des\nMarseillaise.\" Like Koiner's sword song.\nit was immediately learned by heart by\neverybody. Also, like Korner's sword\nsong, or like Jonah's gourd, it grew up, as\nw. see, in a single night. Not to sing it\nwas a disgrace; to be ignorant of it was a'\nmost a crime.\nNapoleon visited those sick of the\nplague in order to prove that the man\nwho could vanquish fear could vanquish\nthe plague also, and he was right. It is\nincredible what force the will has in such\ncases. It penetrates the hody, and put it\ninto a state of activity which repels all\nhurtful influences ; whilst fear invites and\npropagates them.\nThere are 79,000 miles of toleoraph\nwire in the United States, and 6,850 ol\nfices, or one mile of line to every thirty- b\nsix square miles of area.

It measured\nsometh'ng over six feet. It doesn't\nseem that a six-foot alligator coald\nswallow a yearling, but evidently\nthe yearling thought it was trying\nto.

L. Stevenson.)\nWonderful Adaptability of St. Tam\nmany To Poultry.\nThe prospectus of the St. Tam\nmany Poultry Association asserts\nthat there is not a spot in the states\nas well adapted to poultry rais'ng as\nthe Ozone Belt. The Association is\na non-profit, mutual concern, and\nthe basis for its statements are, mild\nclimate, early spring, assuring long\nseasons for growing feed, rolling and\nwell drained land, and an abund\nance of shade and pure water.\nA progressive plan of the Asao\no:'ation is membership co-operation\nco-operation between the members\nbreeding different varieT~es, with the\nview to assist in the sale of egg:\nand stock, and the exchange of males\nto prevent inbreeding. Further, fe\nlowship iwith its practical breeders\nwill be, for the beginner, the equiv\nalent to a course in poultry Instruc\ntion.\nDoes Poultry Pay?\nWould there be any commercial\npoultry plants if it did not? But,\nget the answer at home. A. W.\nJones, of Covington, has a flock of\nfifty Brown Leghorns. During Jan\nuary and February they yielded 1625\neggs, which averaged 50 cents a dez\nen. At what cost? iHis total ex\npenses is estimated at $15 a mon:h.\nHe has no costly equipment, and\ndoes not use an incubator.\nEggs are cheap now. Preserve a\nfew. Two methods are in use--\nwater-glass and lime-salt m':xtures.\nBoth act by excluding air from the\neggs. Water-glass gives the best re\nsults. Use fresh eggs; stale eggs\nwill not keep. Scald the packing\nvessel (ipreferably a stone jar). Add\none part water-glass to 15 to 20 parts\nof water that has been boiled and\ncooled. Pack the eggs in the jar\nand cover with the solution. Keeu\nin a cool place. Do not wash the\neggs, as this removes the mucilagen\nous coating that is Nature's preserv\native. New eggs and solution may\nbe added any tVme, but be sure that\nthere are 2 inches of solution abI-e\nthe eggs. The cost of the preserva\ntive is 1 to 2 cents per dozen eggs.\nWater-glass is a syrup-like liquid\nobtained by melting sand and soda\nat high temperature. A test sample\ncan be obtained on application to the\nSt. Tammany Poultry Association. 1\nThe lime mixture is made' of one\n-pound quick linie, one-half table\nsalt and one gallon of boiled iwatsr.\n----0---(- I\nPROGRESS NOTES.\nA party was given at the residence\nof Mr. and Mrs. Geo.

R. C.\nI submit herewith my report for\nthe month of April.\nAs usual, during the first week, I\ngot out the advisory letters to the\nprenatal cases I have listed. I have\nprocured some nice little leaflets\nfrom the Better Babies Bureau of\nthe Woman's Home Companion,\n\"Clothes for Maternity Wear\" and\n\"'Clothes for the Tiny Better Baby.\"\nI enclose one each to these mothers,\nas they show a set of very practical\npatterns with descriptions of the\nclothes, and I think may prove quite\nuseful.\nOn the 5th I went back to Slidell\nand Dr. Griffith finished examining\nthe school children there.\nThe ladies of Slidell were very\nbusy getting ready for the opening.\nthat night, of a community house.\nI met quite a few. They are very\nenthusiastic workers, and certainly\nare to be commended for their won\nderful spirit and interest in things\nfor the betterment of their town.\nI was invited, that afternoon, to\nmeet the Priscilla Club. This club\nwas organized during the war to sew\nfor the soldiers, and now continues\n---chiefly for its social feature, so\nthe members say---but it is very in\nterested in civic improvement.\nOn the 9th Supt. Lyon invited me\nto meet the School Board and tell\nthem something of what I have been\ndoing in the schools, and of the con\nditions found there. I did so, and\nthey approved of everything and\npassed a vote of thanks to the Red\nCross. They will endeavor to have\nscales placed for the next term in\nthose schools remarning without\nthem, and will have the teachers aid\neach child's weight to his report\nmonthly. This will prove a valu\nable argument, in defective cases,\nwhere the chidl's weight is persist\nently below normal, or he does not\ngain as he should.\nOn the 8th I visited the Lewisburg\nschool. Dr. Paine came from Man\ndeville and examined these children.\nThis school is expected to be consoll\ndated with the Mandeville school\nuanLu wll mte manuevuLe scnool\nnext term and we thought it would\nbe good if these children could be\nexamined by the same doctor, and\nso have exactly the same records.\nMiss Mary Sugg, supervisor of ele\nmentary schools, and I made a trip\ntogether on the 12th. This is a sav\ning of expense as we divide tLe cost\nof the car. We went to the Savan\nnah Branch and Sand H11 schools.\nThe roads were terrible, and we got\nstuck in the mud four times, and the\nlast time had to get an ox team to\npull us out. It is quite the usual\nthing for us to get stuck, but not so\nusual as to have four oven pull as\nfor a couple of blocks. The Sand\nHill school is very fortunate in hav\ning Miss Dollar as teacher, for sel\ndom are teachers quite so interestel\nin their ,pupils welfare as she :s.\nWhen she realized the condition of\nthe children's mouths, and that they\nwere twelve miles from a dentist,\nshe said if the children only had\ntooth brushes she would see to it\nthat they brushed their teeth every\nday at school. Mrs. FitzSimona,\nwho was on this trip with us, said\nthat we could buy the tooth brushes\nand send to her. So the next day\nwe bought two dozen of the proper\nsize and kind, and sent to Miss Dol\nlar. She will sell them at cost to\nthoe able to pay and the others will\nnot be charged.\nThe next day Mess Sugg, Mrs. Fitz\nSimons and I again made a trip to\nthe country and I examined all the\nchildren of the Onward school, and\nstopped in for a few minutes at the\nRamsay school, which I had visited\nin February. One of the children\nthere proudly volunteered the infor\nmation immediately that all of them\nbrush their teeth every day now.\nOn the 21st and 22d I made a\nlong trip with Mr. Lyon and Miss\nSugg, visiting six schools out in the\nother extremity of the parish-Tall\nsheek, Central, Audubon, Robert.\nPearl River and Bonfouca. We spent\nthe night in Slidell, and I again visit\ned their Community House. Saw Dr.\nPolk while there, and he is interest\ned in the parish having an all-time\nman to inspect the schools.\nWe started our traveling dentist\nout to the isolated schools and he\nhas finished four schools, fixing the\nteeth of 164 children. Some of these\nchildren's teeth were in very bad\ncondition, some of them needing as\nmany as seven fillings.\nWe have for this month a total of\n177 dental corrections done, one of\neyes treated, three throats treated\ntContinuec on paga 4)\nWANTED---To buy a good second\nhand Singer wagon.

STUTES.\nMa,' , I;,:.\nDust on Your Glasses.\nI don't often put on my glasses to examine\nKaty's work; but one morning, not long\nsince, I did so upon entering a room that she\nhad been sweeping.\n\"Did you forget to open the windows when\nyou swept, Katy ?\" I inquired, \"this room is\nvery dusty.\"\n\"I think there is dust on your eye glasses,\nmamma,\" she said modestly.\nAnd sure enough the eye-glasses were ati\nfault, and not Katy. I rubbed them off, and\neverything looked bright and clean, the carpet\nlike new, and Katy's face said,\n\"I am glad it was the glasses, and not me\nthis time.\"\nThis has taught me a good lesson, I said to\nmyself, upon leaving the room, and one I shall\nremember through life.\nIn the evening Katy came to me with some\nkitchen trouble. The cook had done so-and\nso, and she said so-and-so. When her story\nwas finiahed, I said, smilingly,\n'There is dust on your glasses, Katy; rub\nthem off, and you wi l see better.\"\nShe understood me, and left the room.\nI told the incident to the children, and it\nis quite common to hear them say to each\nother,\n\"Oh, there is dust on your glasses.\"\nSometimes I am referred to.\n\"Mammy, Harry has dust on his glasses;\ncan't he rub it off ?\"\nWhen I hear a person criticising another,\ncondemning, perhaps, a course he knows noth\ning about, drawing inferences prejudicial to\nthe person or persons, I think, \"There's dust\non your glasses; rub it off,\" The truth is,\neverybody wears these very same glasses.\nI said this to John one day, some little mat\nter coming up that called forth the remark,\n\"There are some people I wish would begin\nto rub, then,\" said he. \"There is Mr. So-and\nso, and Mrs. So-and-so, they are always ready\nto pick at some one, to slur, to hint; I don't\nknow, I don't like them.\"\n\"I think my son John has a wee bit on his\nglasses just now.\"\nlie laughed and aked,\n- a boy to do ?\"\n\"Keep y own well rubbed up, and you\nwill not kno 'hether -thers need it or\n\"I will,\" he re id.\nI think, as a family are all prof\nthat little incident, and thr.\ner forget the meaning of the term of \"There is\ndust on your glasses.\"\nMorTlRS READ Tms.-\"My wife and daughter\nhave both been afflicted for several years with a\nterrible female complaint which kept them\nprostrated for months at a time. My wife had\nfalling of the womb and leucorrhboa, with ex\ntreme nervousness, loss of appetite and general\ndebility, while my daughter had what is termed\nchlorosis, or green sickness, which affected\nevery organ of the body, becoming pale, feeble\nemaciated, and unfit for any duty of life.

Thus speaks Mr.\nArch Speers, of Mississippi.\nA Robber's queer Disguise.\nA few nights ago a Dooley county, Georgia,\nfarmer, whose place is on the river, was walk\ning around near his stock yard, when he\nheard a squealing among his bogs. He look\ned over the fence to learn the cause, when he\nfound a large alligator bhad a dead hog, which\nit had killed, and was trying to make its way\nto the river. He ran to the house for his gun\nand called to several of his hands to go with\nhim to kill the alligator. On arriving at the\nlot the hog had disappeared and so had the\nwater monster. They followed to the river\nbank, and, instead of alligator tracks, discov\nered those of two persons who had the akin of\nan alligator and had used it to accomplish the\npurpose of stealing hogs and making the own\ner, if he should discover them, believe it was\nan alligator. The rowing of a beat down the\nriver could be distinctly heard, but there was\nnothing to pursue in, so the matter was drop\nped until a better opportunity was offered\nfor catehing up with the perpetrators.-Anmer\nican Rep'4lican.\nThe Button Dodge.\n[San Francisco Post.]\nHe drifted into Phil. McGoveri's saloon the\nother evening, wiped his forehead, felt around\nin his pockets, and said with a pleasant smile:\n\"Well, as it seems I have just one ten cent\npiece left to-day I'll take a drink.\"\nWhen the four fingers of Antioch nerve-tangler\nhad been secreted in his remotest recesses, the\ncustomer fumbled among his keys and laid some\nthing on the counter. As he did so he started,\nand said, with a look of amazement.\n\"Great Scott Ljust look at that !\"\n\"I see it,\" said the barkeeper. scornfully re\ngarding the alleged dime. \"It's a suspender\nbutton. What of It?\"\n\"Well, I didn't look at it before. I just felt\nin my pocket, and I'm larmed if it didn't fool\nme. Ahem! I suppose you'll have to put this\ndrink on ice until tomorrow.

Why in every\nalmanac for the past century this man, with\nall his works exposed to the cold night air,\nshould be given the most prominent place in\na literary work like the almanac, we are una\nble to clearly understand. He certainly can\nclaim no degree of consideration for this act.\nIt does not entitle him to any amount of\nprominence, for the public do not thirst for a\nview of a man who has made an aut,psy of\nhimself and is apparently proud of it. What\nthe planets have to do with the cardiac orifice,\nwe do not at this moment know positively, or\nwhy astronomy and the gastric juices should\nhave anything in common.\nAgain we must come ost and confesa our\nignorance as to the bearing that the ram, or\nthe tarantula, or the twins, or the crab, or\nother astronomical delirium tremens may\nhave upon the weather. Of course it is stu\npidity, and we ought to be ashamed of it, but\nwe are in that fix and we cannot help it.\nWhen our son gets old enough to look into\nthese thing, we will see that he isn't left to\ngrope along through life and make a moral\nshow of himself as his father has.-Boomrarg.\nSpring Conundrums.\nWhy, in the spring of the year, do pienies\nbecome epidemic, and young and old, rich and\npoor, rush off into the woods to eat their\nlunch under the ti.es, and be fed on by ticks\nand mosquitos ? It is simply because for tens\nof thousands of years man was in a nomadic\ncondition. He wondered about with his fami\nly in the woods, living on berries and being\nannoyed by insects, and though man has be\ncome cihilized, and lives in a house, yet, to re\nturn to his old v a d V comes over him,\nSaft-r which ha\nyear, and puts\ne til\nto do all the hard\nhe had to dig up the\nt the crop, and gather it until it\nbecame second nature to her. Her husband\nwas kind enough to encourage her to keep on\nby shaking a stick at her when she wanted to\nsit down and rest, but it was below his dignity\nto work. Such was the condition of woman\nfrom the beginning of time. It will be re\nmembered that Adam was too lazy to gather\nin the apples, so Eve had to do it for him. Of\ncourse all this is changed now. All that most\nwomen do in the way of hard work is to dress\nup and ao to parties, butlevery spring she can\nnot resist the impulse to put on her worst\nclothes and drudge with a hoe out in the front\nyard, as she used to do thousands of years ago.\nMANY pcrsons will take no medicine unti\nprostrated on a bed of sickness.

This novel\ninnovation in the world of art, together with\na most praiseworthy and well directed senti\nmentalism has, probably, 'inspired the Boston\nladies to put up a statue in that city in honor\nof another woman, who, like our Margaret,\nthough in a different sphere of life, reflected\nhonor upon her sex. Harrict Martineaun's\nmemory is thus to be oommemorated by the\nfair daughters of the \"Athens of America.\"\nThe cost of the statue will be $15,000, and of\nthis amount all but $1,500 has been ei.ed.\nN.

He works in the\nswamps, cutting cypress, and at the\ntime of the accident was engaged in\ncapturing a four-foot alligator. The\nlatter secured a firma hold on one of the\nman's hands-and seemed to set its jaws,\nas the man's friends found it utterly\nimpossible to open them. He waE\nobliged to come to Lutcher eleven\nmiles, on the log train, with the 'gator\nunder his arm and a firm grip onihii\nhand. He was taken to the company'E\n\"machine shop, where the alligator's 4\njaws were pried open with an iron bat\nand the man released from his trying\nposition.

Reese made an interesting\nchase at St. Martinseville Friday even\ning. Ho went to arrest Henry Jack\nson, colored, who was a fugitive from\nthe parish of St. Mary, where he is ac\ncused of murder committed more than\none year ago. ;The sheriff having\nheard that he was working on Mr.\nMorrow's place, went there to arrest\nhim. As soon as Jackson realized that\nthe sheriff had come to arrest him he\ntook to his heels, with the sheriff in\nclose pursuit. The race was in an open\nfield for fully three miles. The negro\nhad a start of seventy-five yards, and\nmaintained that distance between him\nself and his pursuer until the last.\nThe sheriff, realizing that he was losing\nhis man, shot at him three times, the\nthird shot taking effect in his arm.\nThis seemed to give renewed vigor to\nJackson, and he finally succeeded in\nlosing his pursuer while he fled, hold\ning with one hand his wounded arm.\nSmuggling Whisky Into Alaska.\nNews comes from Alaska that liquor\nof doubtful quality is being smuggled\ninto that territory in large quantities.\nThe shipment of liquor there is uilaw\nful except where special permits are\ngranted, but many saloons receive\nfresh consignments by every steamer,\nthough liquor is never entered on the\nsteamer's manifest, The latest ruse for\ngetting quantities of whisky into the\ninterior is to take it through Alaska in\nbond for British territory beyond.\nBeing prohibited there a bond is given\nBritish customs officers to take it out\nin a specified time. Means are found\nfor the taking of it across the line into\nAlaska to some point not watched by\nAmerican officers.

None\nshall be compelled to observe the\nJewish, Mohammedan, Catholic\nor Protestant form of religion, or\nto embrace any religious denonu\nnation, civilized or pagan, that\nhis judgment or taste may dictate\nas the best or preferable for him.\nWhen we consider the attri\nbutes of the Deity, and of the fa\nture rewards and punishments,\nand the temporal welfare of so^\nciety, government can hardly eon\nsider itself entirely free from the\nfostering care and protection of\nreligion as connected with the per\nsonal, social and domestic virtues\nof its people; but to what extent\ngovernment may \u00bbo in the sup^\nport and protection of religion,\nwith safety and propriety, may\nbe a subject ot much contrariety\nof opinion with statesmen and\npublicists.\nThe vast majority of our people\nprofess a belief in the Christian\nreligion and its existence has\nbeen ieeoguized by the coustitu\ntion trained by them. The follow\nrs of that faith have, from its\nearliest existence and foundation,\negarded and kept Sunday as a\nday ot rest, froo from labor and\ndevoted to religions worship.\nAnd those not attached to any\neligious denomination have hab\nitually kept that day as one of\nrest from secular pursuits; and\nits observance as a day of rest,\nand holy, has for centuries become\nmore than a habit or custom ; it\nhas become a sentiment engrafted\ninto our very social organism, to\nbe observed and respected by all,\nwit hout the sanction of law or de\ncrees ot courts. Aud as a civil\nregulation, it has beeu considered\nimportant for the physical well\nbeing of society that .Sunday bo\nobsei ved as a day of rest from la*\nbor iu order that the mind and\nbody may repose\u2014that the for\nmer may recover or retain its\nmer may recover or\nwonted elasticity and vigor, and\nthe latter may recuperate and be\nprepared for more arduous and\nprotracted exertions in manual\nlabor. And in this view the ob\nservance of Sunday, by a suspen\nsion of all secular pursuits, may\nwith great propriety be enforced\nby civil law.\nThe observance of Sunday we\nbelieve essential to a full enjoy\nment of religious exercises by the\nvarious denominations in the\nspirit cf the constitution of the\nState. How could a set of people\nworship in a city crowded with\nbusy population, and iu the midst\nof the confusion, noise and hustle\nof worldly business, and the prac\ntices deemed by them unholy and\na sacrilegious desecration of that\nholy day f\nThe ordinance complained of\ndoes not. deprive any inhabitant\nof the city of Houston of any of\nthe religions rights and privileges\nguaranteed to him in the Oousti\ntution of the United States or of\nthis State. The mayor and coun\ncil did not attempt to fasten upon\nthe people of the city of Houston\nany particular form of religion\u2014\nJewish, Mohammedan, Koman\nCatholic, Protestant, or Pagan\nnor has the free exercise of the\nrites of any religious deuoruiua\ntion been forbidden or prohibited\nin any way. The right to wor\nship God according to the dicta\ntion of the conscience lias not at\nall been interrupted ; nor is it\nenjoined upon any inhabitaut of\nthe ei'y to attend the religious ex\nercises of any denomination ; and\nhe may decline to attend, and\namuse himself with the metapliys\nical reflections and deductions of\nthe infidel. He is not required\nto attend, erect, or support- any\nplace of worship or to maintain\nany ministry, directly or indirect\nly, contrary to his conscience.\nHis rights of conscience, Ins re\nligious principles and practices un\ntier them, are not at all infringed\nor impaired ; nor does the ordi\nnance pretend to give any prefer\nence to any religion or mode\nworship.\nThe latter clause of the recited\nsection of the State Constitution,\nit will be remembered, provides\nthat it shall be the duty of the\nLegislature to pass such laws\nmay be necessary to protect\nevery religious denomination\nthe peaceable enjoyment of thefr\nown mode of worship. This ordi\n------ \" \u25a0 \u2022 -\nnance of the council of Houstou\nis believed to be of the character\nembraced in this clause. It does\nnot in the least interfere with the\nreligion ot any person, or the ex\nercise thereof. It does not enjoiu\nupon any person the duty of con\nforming his conduct to the rites\nof his eliurcb, but it does prevent\nhim from following a tippling oc\ncupation in the city on Sunday\nby which crowds of persons may\nbe congregated at a public house\nitnd under the influence of iutoxi\ncation, may commit riots and\nbreaches of the peace to the great\nannoyance of otbeis who feel it\ntheir religions duty to desist from\nabor, attend worship aud keep\nthe day holy, and we see a pro\npriety and due respect of the\nsentiment aud custom of oui peo\nple manifested in the rule that\ncompels a cessation from labor ou\nSunday, in order that not only\nman aud beast may recuperate\nand be restored to' health and\nmental and physical vigor but\nthat those who in good faith may\ndesire to keep that day holy, for\nthe worship of God, may remain\nundistuibed in the exercise of\ntheir religious duties; and any\nlaw that tends to this result can\nuot be considered repugnant to\nthe constitution.\nThat there is nothing in the\nConstitution of the United States\nor of this state to prevent the leg\nislature from forbidding the pnr\nsuit ol worldly business upon\nSunday, has been decided in a\nnumber of States. The judgment\nis affirmed .\u2014Houston Age.\nEncouraging: to Young\nSpeakers.\nTo many who remember him\nby the grand title of his later\nyears, \"the Old Man Eloquent,\"\nit will doubtless bo a surprise to\nread in this book how eloquent\nhe was as a young man ; and\nthrough what mortifications and\nfailures and toils he passed in\no.der to acquire his wonderful\npowers as a debater. Thus, un\nder date of loth January, 1803,\nwhen he was a member ot the\nSenate, he writes: ' On this\noccasion, as ou almost every\nother, 1 felt most sensibiy my de\nficienoy as an extemporaneous\nspeaker. * * * It is slowness\nof comprehension\u2014an incapacity\nto grasp the whole compass of a\nsubject iu the mind at once with\nsuch an arrangement as leaves a\nproper impression of the details\u2014\nan incapacity to form ideas pro*\nperly precise and detiuite with\nthe rapidity to\nthe rapidity necessary to givs\nthem uninterrupted utterance.\nMy manner, therefore, is slow,\nhesitating and often much eons\nfused. Sometimes, from inability\nto furnish the words to finish a\nthought commenced, I begin a\nsentence with propriety anti end\nit with nonsense. Sometimes,\n1 after carrying through an idea\nof peculiar force to its last stage,\nthe want of a proper word at tho\nclose drives mo to use one which\nthrows the whole into a burlesque,\nAud sometimes the most import\nant details of an argument escape\nmy mind at the moment when I\nwant them, though ever ready\nto preseut them before aud after.\nAnd hence, in making the transi\ntion from one part of it to the\nother, I am often compelled to\ntake a minute or two for recollec\ntion, which leaves a chasm of si\nlence always disagreeable to the\nhearers. I must, therefore, never\nflatter myself with the ho|>e of\noratorical distinction. At the\nsame time, it is possible that by\ncontinual exertion, application\nand sell-censure, part ot the ill\neffects of these infirmities may be\nicim-dicd.\" Surely in these vvo.'ds,\nand }r the later career of \"the\n\\ old man eloquent,there is mate\nas! rial for instruction and for eu\n' eouragemeut for many a youthful\ni aspirant after oratorical disji.tm\n1 tion.", "batch": "lu_flareon_ver01", "title_normal": "weekly thibodaux sentinel and journal of the 8th senatorial district.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064492/1879-09-20/ed-1/seq-1.json", "place": ["Louisiana--Lafourche--Thibodaux"], "page": ""}]}
