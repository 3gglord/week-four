# Week Four journal

Tim Hitchcock and Matthew Lincoln both wonder if anything new is to be gained by using quantitive approaches to historical questions; we have to make sure that we aren't asking questions that we already know the answer to
think about the collection of digital material that is the basis of research in digital history--which perspectives and voices are present and which are left out?
the white paper argues that digital history is not just a new methodology, it is also a new form of historiography
people have to have some sort of knowledge about statistics, correlation is not causation, have to have contextual knowledge to understand arguments made



- think about how the various authors in the readings make the case for how digital history arguments are advanced. 
- Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant ‘reads’ or ‘views’ of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not. 
- What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? 
- What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes? 
- How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it? 
- How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?
