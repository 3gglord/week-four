# Week Four journal

Tim Hitchcock and Matthew Lincoln both wonder if anything new is to be gained by using quantitive approaches to historical questions; we have to make sure that we aren't asking questions that we already know the answer to
think about the collection of digital material that is the basis of research in digital history--which perspectives and voices are present and which are left out?
the white paper argues that digital history is not just a new methodology, it is also a new form of historiography
visualizations can argue with one another
collections itself can be an argument--the act of selecting and excluding material
more review of digital history and digital public history in scholarly journals
the way digital history is categorized and presented is a form of argument -- how speicific are things labelled? what do historians find important to identify in a source?
people have to have some sort of knowledge about statistics, correlation is not causation, have to have contextual knowledge to understand arguments made
learned how to ask more quesitons about sources, how they are organized, and how I can use that organization to learn more about the source
I find that digital history has us engaging with the sources more than usual history classes--for example, deciding how to clean up data and OCR errors, how to split up a text, choosing which texts go into a corpus, and choosing algorithms and visualizations--all of these decisions are made before interpretations of the sources are made
online medium for publishing historical work allows for citations to be integrated into the writing



- think about how the various authors in the readings make the case for how digital history arguments are advanced. 
- Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant ‘reads’ or ‘views’ of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not. 
- What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? 
- What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes? 
- How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it? 
- How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?
